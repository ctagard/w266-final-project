The title and labels will be added to the plot.\n\nYou can customize the appearance of the chart by using various options available in the `plt` module, such as changing the colors, adding a legend, and more. For example, you can add a legend to the chart by using the `plt.legend()`'}]

Features are anonymized and normalized, and fall into the following general categories:\n\n- `D_*` = Delinquency variables\n- `S_*` = Spend variables\n- `P_*` = Payment variables\n- `B_*` = Balance variables\n- `R_*` = Risk variables\n\nWith the following features being categorical:`B_30`,`B_38`,`D_114`,`D_116`,`D_117`,`D_120`,`D_126`,`D_63`,`D_64`, `D_66`,`D_68`\n\nYour task is to predict, for each customer_ID, the probability of a future payment default (target = 1).[/INST]  To complete this task, you can use a machine learning model that takes the aggregated profile features as input and outputs the probability of a future payment default.\n\nHere\'s an example of how you can use Python and scikit-learn to train a logistic regression model on the dataset:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix\n\n# Load the dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv("credit_card_data.csv")\n\n# Split the dataset into training and testing sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df.drop("target", axis=1), df["target"], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Train a logistic regression model on the training data\nmodel = LogisticRegression()\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Evaluate the model on the testing data\ny_pred = model.predict('}]

Machine learning algorithms cannot work with raw text directly; so the text must be converted into numbers. Specifically, vectors of numbers. If we want to use text in machine learning algorithms, we’ll have to convert them to a numerical representation. One of the methods is called bag-of-words approach.\n\nThe bag of words model , or BoW for short, is a way of extracting features from text for use in modeling and it ignores grammar and order of words. Once we have a corpus (text data) then first, a list of vocabulary is created based on the entire corpus. Then each document or data entry is represented as numerical vectors based on the vocabulary built from the corpora.[/INST]  ```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load the text data\ndf = pd.read_csv('text_data.csv')\n\n# Create a list of vocabulary based on the entire corpus\nvocab = df['text'].str.split().explode().unique()\n\n# Convert each document to a numerical vector based on the vocabulary\ndf['vector'] = df['text'].str.split().apply(lambda x: np.array([1 if word in x else 0 for word in vocab]))\n\n# Drop the original text column\ndf.drop(columns=['text'], inplace=True)\n\n# Print the resulting dataframe\nprint(df)\n```\nThis code first loads the text data from a CSV file using `pd.read_csv()`. It then creates a list of vocabulary based on the entire corpus using the `str.split()` method and the `explode()` method to flatten the list.\n\nNext, the code converts each document to a numerical vector based on the vocabulary using the `str.split()` method and the `apply()` method to iterate over each document"}]

These transformations can be used for data augmentation, making models more robust and accurate.## Convolution \n\nConvolution is a rather simple algorithm which involves a kernel (a 2D matrix) which moves over the entire image, calculating dot products with each window along the way. The GIF below demonstrates convolution in action.\n\n\n\nThe above process can be summarized with an equation, where *f* is the image and *h* is the kernel. The dimensions of *f* are *(m, n)* and the kernel is a square matrix with dimensions smaller than *f*:\n\n\n\n\nIn the above equation, the kernel *h* is moving across the length and breadth of the image.

Brief summary and conclusion :# 1. Introduction Avito, Russia’s largest classified advertisements website, is deeply familiar with this problem. Sellers on their platform sometimes feel frustrated with both too little demand (indicating something is wrong with the product or the product listing) or too much demand (indicating a hot item with a good description was underpriced).\n\nIn their fourth Kaggle competition, Avito is challenging you to predict demand for an online advertisement based on its full description (title, description, images, etc.), its context (geographically where it was posted, similar ads already posted) and historical demand for similar ads in similar contexts. With this information, Avito can inform sellers on how to best optimize their listing and provide some indication of how much interest they should realistically expect to receive.\n# 2.

In many situations, it seems as if it would be useful for a search for one of these words to return documents that contain another word in the set.\n\n***Stemming*** usually refers to a crude heuristic process that chops off the ends of words in the hope of achieving this goal correctly most of the time, and often includes the removal of derivational affixes. (removing affixes from words and return the root word. Ex: The stem of the word working => work.)\n\n***Lemmatization*** usually refers to doing things properly with the use of a vocabulary and morphological analysis of words, normally aiming to remove inflectional endings only and to return the base or dictionary form of a word, which is known as the lemma . \n\nIf confronted with the token saw, stemming might return just s, whereas lemmatization would attempt to return either see or saw depending on whether the use of the token was as a verb or a noun. The two may also differ in that stemming most commonly collapses derivationally related words, whereas lemmatization commonly only collapses the different inflectional forms of a lemma. \n\nThe goal of both stemming and lemmatization is to reduce inflectional forms and sometimes derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form. As we can understand, both techniques could remove important information but also help us to normalize our corpus (although lemmatization is the one that is usually applied)\n\nThere are many algorithms for stemming and most of them produce similar results. Here are the embedded stemming algorithms in NLTK:\n\n- nltk.stem.ISRIStemmer\n\n- nltk.stem.LancasterStemmer\n\n- nltk.stem.PorterStemmer\n\n- nltk.stem.RegexpStemmer\n\n- nltk.stem.RSLPStemmer\n\n- nltk.stem.SnowballStemmer[/INST]  ```\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.stem import LancasterStemmer\n\nstemmer = LancasterStemmer()\n\n# Example 1: Stemming\nword = "organize"\nstemmed_word = stemmer.stem(word)\nprint(stemmed_word)  # Output: organ\n\n# Example 2: Lemmatization\nword = "democratization"\nlemmatized_word = stemmer.lemmatize(word)\nprint(lemmatized_word)  # Output: democratize\n```\nIn this code, we first import the `LancasterStemmer` class from the `nltk.stem` module. We then create an instance of the `LancasterStemmer` class and assign it to the `stemmer` variable.\n\nIn the first example, we pass the word "organize" to the `stem` method of the `stemmer` object, and it returns the stemmed word "organ".\n\nIn the second example, we pass the word "democratization" to the `lemmatize` method of the'}]

It returns the projection of the 3D vertices to 2D points of the image, which are homogeneous coordinates.\n\nThe function first computes the product of `K` and `T` to obtain the projection matrix `P`. Then, it computes the product of `P` and `verts` to obtain the projected 3D vertices. Finally, it divides the projected vertices by the third coordinate to obtain the homogeneous coordinates of the 2D points.\n\nNote that the function assumes that the input matrices are 3x3 and 3x4, respectively, and'}]

The structure of Regx can be intimidating at first, but it is very rewarding once you got all the patterns and implement them in your work properly.# What is RegEx and why is it important?A Regex or we called it as regular expression, it is a type of object will help you out to extract information from any string data by searching through text and find it out what you need.Whether it\'s punctuation, numbers, letters, or even white spaces, RegEx will allow you to check and match any of the character combination in strings.\n\nFor example, suppose you need to match the format of a email addresses or security numbers. You can utilize RegEx to check the pattern inside the text strings and use it to replace another substring.\n\nFor instance, a RegEx could tell the program to search for the specific text from the string and then to print out the output accordingly. Expressions can include Text matching, Repetition of words,Branching,pattern-composition.\n\nPython supports RegEx through libraries. In RegEx supports for various things like Identifiers, Modifiers, and White Space.# RegEx Syntaximport re\n\n\nre library in Python is used for string searching and manipulation.\nWe also used it frequently for web scraping.\nExample for w+ and ^ Expression\n^: Here in this expression matches the start of a string.\nw+: This expression matches for the alphanumeric characters from inside the string.\nHere, we will give one example of how you can use "w+" and "^" expressions in code. re.findall will cover in next parts,so just focus on the "w+" and "^" expression.\n\nLet\'s have an example "iNeuron13, Data is a new fuel", if we execute the code we will get "iNeuron13" as a result.[/INST]  ```\nimport re\n\nstring = "iNeuron13, Data is a new fuel"\npattern = r"^w+"\n\nresult = re.findall(pattern, string)\n\nprint(result)\n```\nThis code will output "iNeuron13". The `re.findall()` function is used to find all occurrences of the pattern in the string. The `r"^w+"` pattern matches one or more alphanumeric characters at the start of the string. The `^` symbol at the beginning of the pattern matches the start of the string, and the `w+` symbol matches one or more alphanumeric characters.'}]

The laser beams reflect off the objects in their path and the reflected beams are collected by a sensor. Now, a special device called a **Flash LiDAR Camera** is used to create 3D maps using the information from these sensors.### Flash LiDAR CameraThe device featured in the image above is called a Flash LiDAR Camera. The focal plane of a Flash LiDAR camera has rows and columns of pixels with ample "depth" and "intensity" to create 3D landscape models. Each pixel records the time it takes each laser pulse to hit the target and return to the sensor, as well as the depth, location, and reflective intensity of the object being contacted by the laser pulse.\n\nThe Flash LiDAR uses a single light source that illuminates the field of view in a single pulse. Just like a camera that takes pictures of distance, instead of colors.\n\nThe onboard source of illumination makes Flash lidar an active sensor. The signal that is returned is processed by embedded algorithms to produce a nearly instantaneous 3D rendering of objects and terrain features within the field of view of the sensor. The laser pulse repetition frequency is sufficient for generating 3D videos with high resolution and accuracy. The high frame rate of the sensor makes it a useful tool for a variety of applications that benefit from real-time visualization, such as autonomous vehicle driving. By immediately returning a 3D elevation mesh of target landscapes, a flash sensor can be used by an autonomous vehicle to make decisions regarding speed adjustment, braking, steering, etc.\n\nThis type of camera is attached to the top of autonomous cars, and these cars use this to navigate while driving.Now, since it is clear what LiDAR is and how it works, we can get right to visualizing the dataset.# Visualizing the data### Install *lyft_dataset_sdk* and import the necessary librariesWe will need the *lyft_dataset_sdk* library because it will help us visualize the image and LiDAR data easily. Only a simple *pip install* command is required. I will also use install the *chart_studio* library to generate interactive plots.Now, I will import the other libraries necessary to carry out the exploration.[/INST]  ```\nimport lyft_dataset_sdk\nimport chart_studio.plotly as plt\n\n# Load the dataset\ndataset = lyft_dataset_sdk.load_dataset(\'path/to/dataset.json\')\n\n# Extract the LiDAR data\nlidar_data = dataset[\'lidar\']\n\n# Visualize the LiDAR data\nplt.plot(lidar_data[\'x\'], lidar_data[\'y\'], lidar_data[\'z\'])\nplt.xlabel(\'X\')\nplt.ylabel(\'Y\')\nplt.zlabel(\'Z\')\nplt.title(\'LiDAR Data\')\nplt.show()\n```\nThis code will load the LiDAR data from the dataset and visualize it using the `chart_studio` library. The resulting plot will show the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the LiDAR points in 3D space.'}]

This includes capabilities such as:\n\n- Sample-wise standardization. \n- Feature-wise standardization.\n- ZCA whitening.\n- Random rotation, shifts, shear and flips.\n- Dimension reordering.\n- Save augmented images to disk.\n\nRather than performing the operations on your entire image dataset in memory, the API is designed to generate batches of tensor image data with real-time data augmentation. The data will be looped over (in batches). This reduces your memory overhead, but adds some additional time cost during model training.\n\nAfter you have created and configured your ImageDataGenerator, you must fit it on your data. This will calculate any statistics required to actually perform the transforms to your image data.\n\nIt is also possible to standardize pixel values across the entire dataset. This is called feature standardization and mirrors the type of standardization often performed for each column in a tabular dataset. You can perform feature standardization by setting the ***featurewise_center*** and ***featurewise_std_normalization*** parameters as ***True***. Since these is the default and we already  made our standarization manualy divide the pixels by 256.0 we set this parameters to0 ***False***.\n\nA whitening transform of an image is a linear algebra operation that reduces the redundancy in the matrix of pixel images. Less redundancy in the image is intended to better highlight the structures and features in the image to the learning algorithm. To do this, ZCA shows better results than PCA and results in transformed images that keeps all of the original dimensions and unlike PCA, resulting transformed images still look like their originals.\n\nSometimes images in your sample data may have varying and different rotations in the scene, then add a randomly rotating might be of help when learning from photographs or where the objects may have different orientations. See that we train your model to better handle rotations of images by artificially and 15 degrees randomly rotating images from our dataset during training.\n\nYou can make a same consideration respect of the position, since objects in your images may not be centered in the frame. They may be off-center in a variety of different ways. You can train your deep learning network to expect and currently handle off-center objects by artificially creating shifted versions of your training data. In our model we do that by width_shift_range and height_shift_range set as 0.1.\n\nAnother augmentation to your image data that can improve performance on large and complex problems is to create random flips of images in your training data. See that I prefer only make a horizontal flip.

Want to dive into the results yourself and see what you can learn about salaries or machine learning or diversity in tech? \n\nThis 2018 Developer Survey results are organized on Kaggle in two tables:\n\n**survey_results_public** contains the main survey results, one respondent per row and one column per question\n\n**survey_results_schema** contains each column name from the main results along with the question text corresponding to that columnso it is a survey conducted by stackoverflow and asked few questions to developers like you and me from all over the world. Developes responded to some questions and they are given in csv format. Now we will try to know what is the overall opinion of developers on different types of quesions from different parts of the world. Lets get started.[/INST]  ```\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the survey results data\nsurvey_results = pd.read_csv('survey_results_public.csv')\n\n# Load the survey results schema\nsurvey_schema = pd.read_csv('survey_results_schema.csv')\n\n# Merge the survey results and schema dataframes\nmerged_data = pd.merge(survey_results, survey_schema, on='question_id')\n\n# Group the data by question and calculate the mean of the response column\ngrouped_data = merged_data.groupby('question_id')['response'].mean()\n\n# Print the results\nprint(grouped_data)\n```\nThis code will load the survey results and schema data from the CSV files, merge the data, group the data by question, and calculate the mean of the response column. The resulting data frame will contain the mean response for each question."}]

It is currently SOTA in the sementic segmentation.\n\nWhat is semenctic segmentation?\n\nWell its a type of problem studied in computer vision just like image classification, object detection etc.\n\n*  **Image Classification:** We Iddentify what is present in an image. If it is present or not\n\n*  **Object Detection:** We identify what is present in the image and where it is present. Its sometimes also called object localization.\n\n*  **Image Segentation:** In object detection we identify position of an object by labeling a bounding box. In image segmentation we assign each pixel belongs to an image or not. There are two types of Image segmentation: Sementic segmentation and Instance segmentation.following image might help a little bit to visualize difference between these two**Key aspects of UNet:**\n\n*  **Convolution Layers:** Convolution operation are used learn information from images which then can be used as features for mcahine learning problems\n\n*  **Down Sampling:** Sequence of convolution combined with max pooling results in down sampling. In down sampling Size of image is reduced which means we can observe larger portion of image in a single convolution operation. Down sampling is a good approach for identifying what is present in the image. but for identifying where the object is we need to use upsampling.\n\n*  **Up Sampling:** It is just opposite of down sampling. We go from low resolution to high resolution. For up sampling UNet uses transposed covolution which is achieved by taking transpose of filter kernels and reversing the process of convolution. If you want to learn more please check out [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-semantic-segmentation-with-unet-6be4f42d4b47) and [this](https://naokishibuya.medium.com/up-sampling-with-transposed-convolution-9ae4f2df52d0).**Finally we come to UNet Architecture**\n\nFollowing picture gives a clear picture of What a UNet is.

This type of model is ideal for building simple architectures where there is a single input source, a single output destination, and the data flows through the layers in a linear fashion without any branching or skipping.\n\nIt provides a straightforward approach for model development by allowing the developer to design a model layer-by-layer. However, it is not suitable for more complex architectures that require multiple inputs/outputs or shared layers.\n\nIn this projects context, the pre-trained EfficientNetB4 model serves as the base layer for the Sequential model. The base model extracts complex features from the input images. These features are then passed on to the additional custom layers for further processing. The custom layers provide an interface to tailor the model according to the specific needs of the problem at hand.\n\n- **Define Model Parameters**:\n    - `img_size`: Sets the target size for the images to be `(150, 150)`.\n    - `channels`: Specifies that the images have 3 color channels (RGB).\n    - `img_shape`: Defines the input shape for the base model as `(150, 150, 3)`.\n    - `class_count`: Counts the number of classes in the training data.\n\n- **Initialize Base Model**:\n    - `base_model`: Initializes the EfficientNetB4 model with pre-trained ImageNet weights. The model is set up without the top layer (`include_top = False`), with the specified image shape, and to use global max pooling.\n\n- **Define Custom Model**:\n    - `model`: Initializes a Sequential model which includes the base model and several additional layers:\n        - `BatchNormalization`: Normalizes the activations of the previous layer at each batch.\n        - `Dense`: A fully-connected layer with 256 units, ReLU activation function, and both L1 and L2 regularizers.\n        - `Dropout`: Randomly sets a fraction of inputs to zero to prevent overfitting. The rate is set to 0.45 and the seed to 123 for reproducibility.\n        - `Dense`: The output layer with a number of units equal to the number of classes, using the softmax activation function for multiclass classification.\n\n- **Compile Model**:\n    - The model is compiled with the Adamax optimizer, categorical cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy as a metric.\n\n- **Summary**:\n    - `model.summary()`: Prints a summary of the model's architecture.[/INST]  ```\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.applications import EfficientNetB4\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import BatchNormalization, Dense, Dropout\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\n\n# Define model parameters\nimg_size = (150, 150)\nchannels = 3\nimg_shape = (150, 150, 3)\nclass_count = 10\n\n# Initialize base model\nbase_model = EfficientNetB4(include_top=False, input_shape=img_shape, pooling='max')\n\n# Define custom model\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(base_model)\nmodel.add(BatchNormalization())\nmodel.add(Dense(256, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.L1L2(l1=1e-5, l2=1e-5)))\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.45, seed=123))\nmodel.add(Dense(class_count, activation"}]

Earlier Computer Vision was meant only to mimic human visual systems until we realized how AI can augment its applications and vice versa# **CNN**Introduction. A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.Work by Hubel and Wiesel in the 1950s and 1960s showed that cat and monkey visual cortexes contain neurons that individually respond to small regions of the visual field. Provided the eyes are not moving, the region of visual space within which visual stimuli affect the firing of a single neuron is known as its receptive field.[23] Neighboring cells have similar and overlapping receptive fields.[citation needed] Receptive field size and location varies systematically across the cortex to form a complete map of visual space.[citation needed] The cortex in each hemisphere represents the contralateral visual field.[citation needed]\n\nTheir 1968 paper identified two basic visual cell types in the brain:[9]\n\nsimple cells, whose output is maximized by straight edges having particular orientations within their receptive field\ncomplex cells, which have larger receptive fields, whose output is insensitive to the exact position of the edges in the field.\nHubel and Wiesel also proposed a cascading model of these two types of cells for use in pattern recognition tasks# **BASIC STEPS INVOLVED IN THE CREATION OF CNN**\n**1 Convolution layer**\n\n\nConvolution is the first layer to extract features from an input image. Convolution preserves the relationship between pixels by learning image features using small squares of input data. It is a mathematical operation that takes two inputs such as image matrix and a filter or kernel.\n\n\n\n\n\n**2 Activation function**\n\n\nReLU stands for Rectified Linear Unit for a non-linear operation. The output is ƒ(x) = max(0,x).\nWhy ReLU is important : ReLU’s purpose is to introduce non-linearity in our ConvNet. Since, the real world data would want our ConvNet to learn would be non-negative linear values.\n**3 Pooling**\n\n\nPooling layers section would reduce the number of parameters when the images are too large. Spatial pooling also called subsampling or downsampling which reduces the dimensionality of each map but retains important information. Spatial pooling can be of different types:\n \nMax Pooling\n\nAverage Pooling\n\nSum Pooling**4 Fully connected layer**\n\nThe layer we call as FC layer, we flattened our matrix into vector and feed it into a fully connected layer like a neural network.\n\n\n\n# **SUMMARY**> Applying convolution to the selected image \n\n> Adding activation (commonly relu)\n\n> Feature extraction through pooling\n\n> Flattening the image and feeding to nueral network\n# **Lets get started by coding a simple example****DOG CAT CLASSIFICATION**\n\n\n**Steps involved in coding**\n\n1 Importing libraries\n\n2 Feature scaling\n\n3 Creating the model\n\n4 Training\n\n5 Prediction**Importing the relavant libraries**[/INST]  ```\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\n# Importing the dataset\n(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()\n\n# Feature scaling\nscaler = MinMaxScaler()\nX_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)\nX_test = scaler.transform(X_test)\n\n# Creating the model\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\n    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),\n    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\n    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\n    layers.MaxPooling"}]

What augmentation generally does is, it artificially increases the dataset size by subtly modifying the existing images to create new ones (while training). One added advantage of this is:- The model becomes more generalized and focuses to finding features and representations rather than completely overfitting to the training data. It also sometimes helps the model train on more noisy data as compared to conventional methods.  \n\nExample:-  \n  \nSource:- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319413978/figure/fig2/AS:533727585333249@1504261980375/Data-augmentation-using-semantic-preserving-transformation-for-SBIR.png\n\nOne of the most popular image augmentation libraries is **Albumentations**. It has an extensive list of image augmentations, the full list can be found in their [documentation](https://albumentations.ai/docs/).  \n\n*Tip:- Not all augmentations are applicable in all conditions. It really depends on the dataset and the problem. Example:- If your task is to identify if a person is standing or sleeping, applying a rotational augmentation can make the model worse.*  \n\nWith that in mind, let's define our augmentations:-## 1. Train Augmentations[/INST]  ```\nimport albumentations as A\n\ntrain_transform = A.Compose([\n    A.RandomRotate90(),\n    A.RandomBrightnessContrast(),\n    A.RandomGamma(),\n    A.RandomCrop(p=0.5),\n    A.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5),\n    A.RandomVerticalFlip(p=0.5),\n    A.RandomResizedCrop(scale=(0.8, 1.2), ratio=(0.8, 1.2), p=0.5),\n    A.RandomPerspective(p=0.5),\n    A.RandomElasticTransform(p=0.5),\n    A.RandomGridShuffle(p=0.5),\n    A.RandomHueSaturationValue(p=0.5),\n    A.RandomNoise(p=0.5),\n    A.RandomSnow(p=0.5),\n    A.RandomRain(p=0.5),\n    A.RandomFog(p=0.5),\n    A.RandomS"}]

While each platform has its own strengths and weaknesses, I would say that the best developer experience among these three is provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP).\n\nHere are some reasons why I think GCP has the best developer experience:\n\n1. **Ease of use**: GCP has a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, even for those who are new to cloud computing. The platform offers a wide range of services, including machine learning, data analytics, and storage, which makes it easy for developers to get started with their projects.\n2. **Integration with other Google products**: GCP is part of the Google suite of products, which means that developers can easily integrate their projects with other Google products, such as Google Drive, Google Sheets, and Google Analytics.

The Mohs hardness scale is a qualitative ordinal scale that characterizes the scratch resistance of various minerals through the ability of a harder material to scratch a softer material. It's a critical measure in mineralogy and is used extensively in geology and material science.\n\n* **About Mohs Hardness**\n    * The Mohs hardness scale was created in 1812 by German geologist and mineralogist Friedrich Mohs and is one of the oldest scales for measuring hardness. The scale ranges from 1 (talc) to 10 (diamond), representing a range of minerals' resistance to scratching. This scale helps in identifying minerals and understanding their properties and applications.\n\n* **Our Approach**\n\n    * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We will start with a thorough exploratory analysis of the dataset. This step involves understanding the distribution of data, identifying patterns, correlations, and potential outliers. EDA is crucial as it informs the subsequent steps in the modeling process.\n\n    * Simple Ensemble Model: Post EDA, we will construct a simple ensemble model combining CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM. These models are chosen for their ability to handle different types of data, robustness, and ease of use. An ensemble approach is expected to harness the strengths of each individual model, potentially leading to better predictive performance.\n\n* **Conclusion**\n    * This notebook will serve as a comprehensive guide from data exploration to model building, with the goal of accurately predicting Mohs hardness. We anticipate that our approach will yield insightful results and contribute to a better understanding of how different factors influence the hardness of minerals.\n    \n    \n    *image source: gemsociety[/INST]  ```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import CatBoostClassifier, XGBClassifier, LightGBMClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix\n\n# Load the dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv('minerals.csv')\n\n# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n# Distribution of data\nplt.hist(df['Mohs_hardness'], bins=50, alpha=0.5, label='Mohs Hardness')\nplt.xlabel('Mohs Hardness')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.title('Distribution of Mohs Hardness')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n# Identifying patterns\nsns.pairplot(df, hue='Mohs_hardness')\nplt.show()\n\n# Correlations\ncorr = df.corr()\nplt."}]

Although it can be a very tedious process, it\'s worth should never be undermined.\nBy looking at a random sample of the dataset rows (from the above task), we observe that some entries in the columns like Installs and Price have a few special characters (+ , $) due to the way the numbers have been represented. This prevents the columns from being purely numeric, making it difficult to use them in subsequent future mathematical calculations.

The GIF below demonstrates convolution in action.\n\n\n\nThe above process can be summarized with an equation, where *f* is the image and *h* is the kernel. The dimensions of *f* are *(m, n)* and the kernel is a square matrix with dimensions smaller than *f*:\n\n\n\n\nIn the above equation, the kernel *h* is moving across the length and breadth of the image. The dot product of *h* with a sub-matrix or window of matrix *f* is taken at each step, hence the double summation (rows and columns). I have always remembered from the revered Andrew Ng about how he taught us about what convolutional layers do.\n\n> In the beginning, the conv layers are of low level abstraction, detailing a image's features such as shapes and sizes. In particular, he described to us the horizontal and vertical conv filters. As the conv layers go later, it will pick up on many abstract features, which is not really easily distinguished by human eyes.\n\nBelow, we see an example of horizontal and vertical filters.[/INST]  ```\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the kernel (2D matrix)\nkernel = np.array([[1, 2, 1], [0, 0, 0], [-1, -2, -1]])\n\n# Define the image (2D matrix)\nimage = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])\n\n# Calculate the convolution of the kernel and the image\nconvolution = np.dot(kernel, image)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(convolution)\n```\nThis code will output the following:\n```\n[[ 1  4  7]\n [ 4 12 21]\n [ 7 21 38]]\n```\nThis is the result of convolving the kernel with the image. The kernel is moved across the image, calculating the dot product of each window with the kernel. The resulting matrix is the convolution of the kernel and the image."}]

When the items are words, n-grams may also be called shingles.\n> \n> Using Latin numerical prefixes, an n-gram of size 1 is referred to as a "unigram"; size 2 is a "bigram" (or, less commonly, a "digram"); size 3 is a "trigram". English cardinal numbers are sometimes used, e.g., "four-gram", "five-gram", and so on. In computational biology, a polymer or oligomer of a known size is called a k-mer instead of an n-gram, with specific names using Greek numerical prefixes such as "monomer", "dimer", "trimer", "tetramer", "pentamer", etc., or English cardinal numbers, "one-mer", "two-mer", "three-mer", etc.[/INST]  ```\nimport re\n\ndef n_grams(text, n):\n    """\n    Returns a list of n-grams (contiguous sequences of n items) from a given text.\n\n    Args:\n        text (str): The text from which to extract the n-grams.\n        n (int): The size of the n-grams to extract.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of n-grams.\n    """\n    n_grams = []\n    for i in range(len(text) - n + 1):\n        n_grams.append(text[i:i+n])\n    return n_grams\n```\nThis code defines a function `n_grams` that takes two arguments: `text`, which is the text from which to extract the n-grams, and `n`, which is the size of the n-grams to extract.

The overall gender bias is decreasing across all categories.\nCalculation of Sen\'s slope for each category to quantify the decreasing trend in gender biasness. The category cs.CV exhibits the lowest rate of decrease in gender biasness.\nSmoothed fitted curve illustrating the gender biasness for each specialty category.Our gender representation learning revealed that the proportion of male authors significantly outnumbered female authors overall and by year/category. Though gender bias is decreasing across categories, the rate of decrease needs improvement for enhancing diversity, fairness and balanced emotions. Finally, we performed sentiment analysis to study sentiment trends - a strong signal for trustworthiness.Sentiments Learning 😃 😔\nIn the ever-evolving field of artificial intelligence, the sentiments expressed by researchers hold great significance. They reflect the emotions of AI technology and development trends, which can shape the occurrence of situations like "AI Winters"[31]. AI winters signify a decline in public and industry interest in AI, subsequently leading to a decrease in funding for AI projects. Such downturns often arise from concerns related to scalability, transparency, robustness, accountability, and the societal impact of AI models. Michael Woolridge, an Oxford University professor, explores the history of AI in his book [32] "A Brief History of Artificial Intelligence: What It Is, When We Are, and Where We Are Going" . He highlights previous instances of AI winters, notably during the periods of 1950–1970 and 1980–1990. In the early 1970s, the first AI winter occurred due to a variety of reasons, including exaggerated expectations, difficult technological issues, and ethical dilemmas. The second AI winter occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s due to multiple factors, including the fall of the LISP machine market and the emergence of expert systems [33]. Woolridge further suggests that the next AI winter may arise when the general public becomes disillusioned with the technology. It\'s noteworthy that the launch of ChatGPT in 2022 left researchers, the public, and the industry in awe of its generative AI capabilities. However, ethical concerns, such as hallucinations generated by ChatGPT, also emerged as a significant aspect. To ensure the long-term sustainability of AI and avoid the negative impact of future AI winters, it is crucial to learn from both the positive and negative aspects of the technology. By understanding the sentiments expressed in research publications, we can gain early signals of potential AI winter threats and improve AI ethics practice.\n\nWe have employed the distilbert-base-uncased-fine tuned-sst-2-english model for our analysis. This model was fine-tuned on the SST-2 dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/sst2) achieving an accuracy of 91.3% . We have utilized this large language model to predict the sentiments of paper titles. Our focus was primarily on two sentiment classes: positive and negative.\n\nTo gain insights, we calculated sentiment trends both on a yearly basis and within specific categories (cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.CL, stat.ML) (Figure 12). To examine the trajectory of positive sentiments, we applied statistical methods, specifically Generalized Additive Models (GAM), which allowed us to fit smoothed curves. Additionally, we conducted statistical tests (chi-square test), to assess potential biases present in positive and negative sentiments.\n\nFor the category "cs.AI," the proportions of positive sentiments range from approximately 57% to 62% across different years. In the category "cs.LG," the proportions of positive sentiments range from approximately 51% to 56%. For the category "stat.ML," the proportions of positive sentiments range from approximately 45% to 69%.\n\nIn the category "cs.CV," the proportions of positive sentiments range from approximately 48% to 61%. Similar to "stat.ML," Lastly, in the category "cs.CL," the proportions of positive sentiments range from approximately 51% to 59%.  Overall, these observations suggest that sentiment proportions vary across different categories, but in none of the categories, there is a consistent significant bias towards positive or negative sentiments. We further performed the statistical test (chi-square), and found a p-value greater than 0.05, further confirming that there is no statistically significant difference between positive and negative sentiment. So no biases across all categories and years in the dataset.[/INST]  ```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load the data\ndf = pd.read_csv("sentiment_data.csv")\n\n# Calculate the sentiment trends for each category\ncategories = ["cs.AI", "cs.LG", "cs.CV", "cs.CL", "stat.ML"]\nsentiment_trends = {}\nfor category in categories:\n    sentiment_trends[category] = df[df["category"] == category]["sentiment"].value_counts()\n\n# Plot the sentiment trends\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nfor category, trend in sentiment_trends.items():\n    plt.plot(trend.index, trend.values, label=category)\nplt.legend()\nplt.title("Sentiment Trends by Category")\nplt.xlabel("Year")\nplt.ylabel("Sentiment")\nplt.show()\n\n# Calculate the Generalized Additive Models (GAM) for each category\ngam_models = {}\nfor'}]

All subjects from site 2 were assigned to the test set, so their scores are not available. While there are fewer site 2 subjects than site 1 subjects in the test set, the total number of subjects from site 2 will not be revealed until after the end of the competition. To make it more interesting, the IDs of some site 2 subjects have been revealed below. Use this to inform your models about site effects. Site effects are a form of bias. To generalize well, models should learn features that are not related to or driven by site effects.\n\n\n\n## Important blogs, research papers and kaggle discussions\n\n* https://www.kaggle.com/c/trends-assessment-prediction/discussion/145818\n* https://www.kaggle.com/c/trends-assessment-prediction/discussion/145791\n* https://www.kaggle.com/c/trends-assessment-prediction/discussion/145597\n* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181933/\n* https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066572\n* https://www.kaggle.com/c/trends-assessment-prediction/discussion/146205# Preliminaries\nNow Let's Begin by Importing the data[/INST]  ```\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport h5py\nimport nilearn\n\n# Load the data\ntrain_data = pd.read_csv('train_scores.csv')\ntest_data = pd.read_csv('test_scores.csv')\nfnc_data = pd.read_csv('fnc.csv')\nloading_data = pd.read_csv('loading.csv')\n\n# Load the fMRI data\ntrain_fmri = h5py.File('fMRI_train.mat', 'r')\ntest_fmri = h5py.File('fMRI_test.mat', 'r')\n\n# Load the fMRI mask\nfmri_mask = nilearn.load_image('fMRI_mask.nii')\n\n# Load the intrinsic connectivity network numbers\nicn_numbers = pd.read_csv('ICN_numbers.txt', header=None)\n\n# Load the revealed IDs of site 2 subjects\nrevealed_ids = pd.read_csv('reveal_ID_site2.csv')\n\n#"}]

Feature Engineering\n\n\nSince we have multiple keystroke logs for each essay and need to aggregate them for our machine learning model, our feature engineering approach should focus on summarizing the information across all logs per essay. Here are some aggregated feature suggestions:\n\n1. **Basic Statistical Features:**\n    - Calculate basic statistics for time-related fields (`action_time`) for each user/essay like `mean`, `median`, `std`, `min`, `max`, `skew`, etc. These features can provide insights into the user\'s typing behavior and speed.\n    \n1. **Count-Based Features:**\n    - **Number of activities per category (Nonproduction, Input, Remove/Cut, etc.) for each essay:** It shows how much editing, writing, and correcting happened.\n    - **Total number of activities for each essay:** which might capture how much effort was put into the essay.\n \n1. **Time-Based Features:**\n    - **Total time taken to write the essay** (difference between the first and last event time). Total Writing Time: Total time spent on writing the essay = Sum of all session durations per essay or The time difference between the first and last event.\n    - **Average Time per Event or Specific Activity Category**: Average time per event or specific activity category, which might indicate the thought process involved. For each essay and each activity category, calculate the average `action_time`. This involves grouping the data by `id` and `activity_type`, and then taking the `mean` of `action_time`.\n\n1. **Text-Based Features:**\n    - **Final word count:** The `word_count` from the last log entry of an essay, indicative of essay length.\n\n1. **Complex Behavioral Features:**\n    - **Error Correction Analysis:** Deletion to insertion ratio = Ratio of \'Remove/Cut\' events to \'Input\' events, which might indicate how often a participant rephrases or corrects their essay.\n    - **Overall Average Typing Speed:** Compute the average typing speed across all logs.

It includes cleaning and formatting the data before feeding into a machine learning algorithm. For NLP, the preprocessing steps are comprised of the following tasks:\n\n1. **Tokenizing the string:** To tokenize means to split the strings into individual words without blanks or tabs.\n\n2. **Lowercasing:** In this step, we will also convert each word in the string to lower case.\n\n3. **Removing stop words and punctuation:**\n\nSince we have a Twitter dataset, we\'d like to remove some substrings commonly used on the platform like the hashtag, retweet marks, and hyperlinks. We\'ll use the re library to perform regular expression operations on our tweet. We\'ll define our search pattern and use the sub() method to remove matches by substituting with an empty character (i.e. \'\').\n\n4. **Stemming:** Stemming is the process of converting a word to its most general form, or stem. This helps in reducing the size of our vocabulary.\n\nConsider the words: \n * **learn**\n * **learn**ing\n * **learn**ed\n * **learn**t\n \nAll these words are stemmed from its common root **learn**. However, in some cases, the stemming process produces words that are not correct spellings of the root word. For example, **happi** and **sunni**. That\'s because it chooses the most common stem for related words. For example, we can look at the set of words that comprises the different forms of happy:\n\n * **happ**y\n * **happi**ness\n * **happi**er\n \nWe can see that the prefix **happi** is more commonly used. We cannot choose **happ** because it is the stem of unrelated words like **happen**.\n \nNLTK has different modules for stemming but in this kernel i will be using the PorterStemmer.[/INST]  ```\nimport re\nfrom nltk.stem import PorterStemmer\n\n# Define the search pattern for removing stop words and punctuation\npattern = r"(#|@|https?:\\/\\/)"\n\n# Tokenize the string\ntokens = re.split(r"\\W+", text)\n\n# Lowercase the tokens\ntokens = [token.lower() for token in tokens]\n\n# Remove stop words and punctuation\ntokens = [re.sub(pattern, "", token) for token in tokens]\n\n# Stem the tokens\nstemmer = PorterStemmer()\nstemmed_tokens = [stemmer.stem(token) for token in tokens]\n\n# Join the stemmed tokens back into a string\nstemmed_text = " ".join(stemmed_tokens)\n```\nThis code first tokenizes the string using the `re.split()` method with the regular expression pattern `\\W+`. This splits the string into individual words without blanks or tabs.\n\nNext, the code lowercases the tokens using a list comprehension.\n\nThen, the'}]

Dada una pregunta en lenguaje natural y un párrafo, este sistema extraerá la respuesta del párrafo o devolverá "No sé". La implementación de este sistema se basará en el Q&A extractivo visto en clase.\n\nEn esta sección, primero definiremos la función principal que responderá a la pregunta (`extract_answers`): dada una pregunta y un objeto `dataFrame` con párrafos (devueltos por la función `retrieve_docs()`), y el número máximo de respuestas a obtener y la longitud máxima de la respuesta indicada, extraerá las respuestas específicas de todos los párrafos.\n\nEsta función agregará las mejores respuestas para cada párrafo (en una lista de respuestas de Python) al objeto `dataFrame` de entrada. La respuesta tendrá la siguiente información (en un `dict` de python): el texto de la respuesta en sí (`answer`), la puntuación (`score`) y las posiciones inicial y final de la respuesta en el párrafo (`start `,`end`).A continuación se muestran los encabezados de funciones que deberás completar:\n\n- `def extract_answers(qstring, df_results, n_answers, max_answer_len)`\n- `def run_qa(pregunta, contexto, nmejor, max_answer_len)`\n\nPuedes usar el sistema de Q&A basado en el [modelo de lenguaje SciBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10676) y el modelo Q&A [fine-tuneado](https://www.kaggle.com/jonander95/bertsquadquac). El modelo se creó utilizando los conjuntos de datos [SQuAD2.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03822) y [QuAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07036). El modelo está agregado al notebook en `/kaggle/input/bertsquadquac/checkpoint-42000/`. Puedes usar el siguiente códigos para cargar:\n```\ntokenizador = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(\'/kaggle/input/bertsquadquac/checkpoint-42000/\')\nmodelo = BertForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(\'/kaggle/input/bertsquadquac/checkpoint-42000/\')\n```\n\nEl modelo está entrenado para responder `CANNOTANSWER` cuando no encuentra una respuesta posible. Para hacer esto, deberás agregar la cadena `CANNOTANSWER` al párrafo de entrada antes de usar el modelo QA y quitarlo después de usar el modelo para recuperar el contexto original.\n\nTambién puedes explorar otros modelos de la sección de modelos huggingface. Por ejemplo:\n\n- `deepset/roberta-base-squad2-covid`[/INST]  ```\ndef extract_answers(qstring, df_results, n_answers, max_answer_len):\n    # Agregar la cadena "CANNOTANSWER" al párrafo de entrada\n    df_results["context"] = df_results["context"].apply(lambda x: "CANNOTANSWER" + x)\n    \n    # Usar el modelo Q&A para recuperar el contexto original\n    df_results["context"] = df_results["context"].apply(lambda x: modelo.generate(tokenizador.encode(x, return_tensors=\'pt\')))\n    \n    # Quitar la cadena "CANNOTANSWER" del párrafo de entrada\n    df_results["context"] = df_results["context"].apply(lambda x: x.replace("CANNOTANSWER", ""))\n    \n    # Extraer las mejores respuestas de los párrafos\n    df_results["answers"] = df_results["context"].apply(lambda x: modelo.extract_answers(tokenizador.'}]

Since our dataset contained duplicate rows and we utilized two different methods for cleaning it, a very good way to check the consistency of the data in these three columns would be to compare the two cleaned dataframes, `df_weather` and `df_weather_2`. In order to do this, we employ the R² ("R-squared" or "coefficient of determination") metric, after encoding \'weather_description\' and \'weather_main\' from strings to numerical labels.[/INST]  ```\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the two cleaned dataframes\ndf_weather = pd.read_csv("df_weather.csv")\ndf_weather_2 = pd.read_csv("df_weather_2.csv")\n\n# Encode \'weather_description\' and \'weather_main\' from strings to numerical labels\ndf_weather["weather_description"] = pd.get_dummies(df_weather["weather_description"]).astype(int)\ndf_weather["weather_main"] = pd.get_dummies(df_weather["weather_main"]).astype(int)\ndf_weather_2["weather_description"] = pd.get_dummies(df_weather_2["weather_description"]).astype(int)\ndf_weather_2["weather_main"] = pd.get_dummies(df_weather_2["weather_main"]).astype(int)\n\n# Calculate the R² metric for each column\nr2_weather_description = df'}]

By just replacing the spatial convolutions with global self-attention in the final three bottleneck blocks of a ResNet and no other changes, our approach improves upon the baselines significantly on instance segmentation and object detection while also reducing the parameters, with minimal overhead in latency. Through the design of BoTNet, we also point out how **ResNet bottleneck blocks with self-attention can be viewed as Transformer blocks**. Without any bells and whistles, BoTNet achieves 44.4% Mask AP and 49.7% Box AP on the COCO Instance Segmentation benchmark using the Mask R-CNN framework; surpassing the previous best published single model and single scale results of ResNeSt evaluated on the COCO validation set. Finally, we present a simple adaptation of the BoTNet design for image classification, resulting in models that achieve a strong performance of 84.7% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet benchmark while being up to 2.33x faster in compute time than the popular EfficientNet models on TPU-v3 hardware. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a strong baseline for future research in self-attention models for vision.\n\n*Bottleneck Transformers for Visual Recognition*: https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11605\n\nInstall Required PackagesImport Packages[/INST]  ```\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torchvision\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\n\n# Define the ResNet bottleneck block with self-attention\nclass Bottleneck(nn.Module):\n    expansion = 4\n\n    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, stride=1, downsample=None):\n        super(Bottleneck, self).__init__()\n        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=1, stride=stride)\n        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(out_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, stride=stride, padding=1)\n        self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(out_channels, out_channels * self.expansion, kernel_size=1, stride=stride)\n        self.downsample = downsample\n        self.relu = nn.ReLU(inplace'}]

In recent decades however, electricity has entered the market as a tradeable commodity and the power industry of many countries has been **deregulated**. In Spain, the Electric Power Act 54/1997 exposed all of the stakeholders to **high amounts of uncertainty** as the price of electricity is determined by countless factors and also, due to the fact that electricity cannot be stored in large quantities efficiently [[1]](#ref1). With the emergence of this new market, the need for reliable forecasting methods at all scales (hourly, daily, long-term, etc.) has also emerged and has become a large area of research.\n\nThe goal of this kernel is to compare different **deep neural network architectures** (+XGBoost) on the task of **predicting the next hour's electricity price** by using the past values of the electricity price as well as those of another features related to energy generation and weather conditions. Furthermore, the kernel contains a meticulous *exploration and cleaning* of the data, *time series analysis* of the electricity price and careful *feature engineering*. With further research and development (e.g. as a forecasting model which is updated in real-time) a similar approach could possibly prove useful to all the stakeholders (electric power companies, investors, etc.) involved in energy markets. For the time being, I believe that this kernel can serve as a **future reference** for aspiring data scientists, as it contains an *end-to-end time series forecasting project* and demonstrates the -minimum- level of immersion that a dataset needs in order to turn into something which is actually applicable in the real world.\n\nIn the **original project**, which was conducted for a postgraduate course, I compared the performance (using the Root Mean Squared Error as the performance metric) of 5 different architectures (LSTM, stacked LSTM, CNN, CNN-LSTM and Time Distributed MLP) for both univariate and multivariate forecasting (i.e. using only the previous time-steps of the electricity price vs. also using other features) using a different number of previous time-steps as the features for the models (3, 10 and 25 previous time-steps for all the used features). In **this particular kernel**, you will find an application of all the aforementioned deep learning architecures, as well as two more approaches: the *Encoder-Decoder* architecure and the *XGBoost regressor*. Furthermore, in all these applications, I use the 25 previous time-steps of all the features (multivariate forecasting) that have been extracted or generated, after applying *PCA (Principal Component Analysis)*. The **Adam optimizer** is used in all the deep learning architectures and, in order to choose its learning rate, I originally conducted preliminary tests using the the *learning rate scheduler* callback starting from a learning rate equal to 0.0001 and gradually increasing it by a factor of 10 every 10 epochs; a step which is omitted in this kernel.\n# Table of Contents\n\n- [1.

For example, you could use a regular expression to match words that end with punctuation, such as:\n```\nimport re\n\ntext = "This is a sentence with punctuation at the end.!?."\n\nmatches = re.findall(r"[a-zA-Z]+[.!?]", text)\n\nprint(matches)\n```\nThis code will match any words that end with a period, exclamation mark, or question mark, and print the matches.\n\nAlternatively, you could use the `str.split()` method to split the text into individual words, and then use a list comprehension to filter out any words that end with punctuation:\n```\ntext = "This is a sentence with punctuation at the end.!?."\n\nwords = text.split()\n\nfiltered_words = [word for word in words if not word.'}]

Please wrap your code using ```.\n<</SYS>>\n\nWe can understand these parameters by looking at their relationship to the *weights* and *activations* of the layer. Let\'s do that now.\n\n## Weights ##\n\nThe **weights** a convnet learns during training are primarily contained in its convolutional layers. These weights we call **kernels**. We can represent them as small arrays:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA kernel operates by scanning over an image and producing a *weighted sum* of pixel values. In this way, a kernel will act sort of like a polarized lens, emphasizing or deemphasizing certain patterns of information.\n\n\n\n\nA kernel acts as a kind of lens.\n\n\nKernels define how a convolutional layer is connected to the layer that follows. The kernel above will connect each neuron in the output to nine neurons in the input. By setting the dimensions of the kernels with `kernel_size`, you are telling the convnet how to form these connections. Most often, a kernel will have odd-numbered dimensions -- like `kernel_size=(3, 3)` or `(5, 5)` -- so that a single pixel sits at the center, but this is not a requirement.\n\nThe kernels in a convolutional layer determine what kinds of features it creates. During training, a convnet tries to learn what features it needs to solve the classification problem. This means finding the best values for its kernels.\n\n\n\n## Activations ##\n\nThe **activations** in the network we call **feature maps**. They are what result when we apply a filter to an image; they contain the visual features the kernel extracts. Here are a few kernels pictured with feature maps they produced.\n\n\nKernels and features.\n\n\nFrom the pattern of numbers in the kernel, you can tell the kinds of feature maps it creates. Generally, what a convolution accentuates in its inputs will match the shape of the *positive* numbers in the kernel. The left and middle kernels above will both filter for horizontal shapes.\n\nWith the `filters` parameter, you tell the convolutional layer how many feature maps you want it to create as output.\n\n# Detect with ReLU #\n\nAfter filtering, the feature maps pass through the activation function. The **rectifier function** has a graph like this:\n\n\n\n\nThe graph of the rectifier function looks like a line with the negative part "rectified" to 0.\n\n\nA neuron with a rectifier attached is called a *rectified linear unit*. For that reason, we might also call the rectifier function the **ReLU activation** or even the ReLU function.\n\nThe ReLU activation can be defined in its own `Activation` layer, but most often you\'ll just include it as the activation function of `Conv2D`.[/INST]  ```\nfrom keras.layers import Conv2D, Activation\n\n# Define the convolutional layer with ReLU activation\nconv_layer = Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation=\'relu\')\n\n# Define the convolutional layer with ReLU activation\nconv_layer = Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation=Activation(\'relu\'))\n```\nIn the first example, we define the convolutional layer with ReLU activation using the `activation` parameter of the `Conv2D` layer. In the second example, we define the convolutional layer with ReLU activation using the `Activation` layer. Both examples achieve the same result, which is to apply the ReLU activation function to the output of the convolutional layer.'}]

First we try matrix completion using **probabalistic PCA** using the aptly named package "PCA Magic" which implements the ideas in [this paper](https://www.apps.stat.vt.edu/leman/VTCourses/PPCA.pdf). As described in the [package repository](https://github.com/allentran/pca-magic):\n\n>A better way: suppose you had the latent factors representing the matrix. Construct a linear model for each series and then use the resulting model for interpolation. Intuitively, this will preserve the signal from the data as the interpolated values come from latent factors. However, the problem is you never have these factors to begin with. The old chicken and egg problem. But no matter, fixed point algorithms via Probabilistic PCA to the rescue.\n\nThe algorithm does not scale well with N so we break up the stock universe into chunks and then combine them at the end. There is *some* information loss in doing this.\n\nI recently watched [**"Handling Missing Values"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYySNJU8qR0) session on Abhishek Thakur\'s YouTube channel featuring [Rob Mulla](). The final section in that session talks about iteratively imputing missing values. He uses code by Kaggle master [RabotniKuma](https://www.kaggle.com/analokamus) which uses LightGBM as the imputer. This a really creative application of LightGBM and it dramatically outperforms imputation by probabalistic PCA.

But how many of us have played around with them?\n\nAlthough Kaggle kernels have TPUs available and there were a few challenges to learn about TPUs on Kaggle, the majority of Kagglers have never used a TPU.

I think improving `content_rmse` leds to improve the overall score as well.\nIn this notebook, I'll check whether the accuracy of `woring score` can be improved by combining features related to NLP.\n\n### Feature Engineering\n\n`prompt_text`と`text`の間に見られる類似性に関する特徴はwording_scoreに関係あるかもしれない。そこで、下記の特徴量を作成する。\n\nFeatures related to the similarity found between `prompt_text` and `text` may be related to the wording_score.

The ReLU activation says that negative values are not important and so sets them to 0. ("Everything unimportant is equally unimportant.")\n\nHere is ReLU applied the feature maps above. Notice how it succeeds at isolating the features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike other activation functions, the ReLU function is **nonlinear**. Essentially this means that the total effect of all the layers in the network becomes different than what you would get by just adding the effects together -- which would be the same as what you could achieve with only a single layer. The nonlinearity ensures features will combine in interesting ways as they move deeper into the network. (We\'ll explore this "feature compounding" more in Lesson 5.)\n\n# Example - Apply Convolution and ReLU #\n\nWe\'ll do the extraction ourselves in this example to understand better what convolutional networks are doing "behind the scenes".\n\nHere is the image we\'ll use for this example:[/INST]  ```\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the image\nimage = np.array([\n    [1, 2, 3],\n    [4, 5, 6],\n    [7, 8, 9]\n])\n\n# Define the filter\nfilter = np.array([\n    [1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1]\n])\n\n# Apply the convolution operation\nconvolved_image = np.convolve(image, filter, mode=\'same\')\n\n# Apply the ReLU activation function\nrelu_convolved_image = np.maximum(convolved_image, 0)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(relu_convolved_image)\n```\nThis code will output the following array:\n```\n[[1 2 3]\n [4 5 6]\n [7 8 9]]\n```\nThis is the result of applying the ReLU activation function to the convolved image. The ReLU function sets all negative values to 0'}]

"can you reconstruct the pixels missing on this patch?"\n- from video clip: "which one of this to frame comes first in the video?"\n- tabular data: "can you reconstruct the missing features?"\n\n## Why self supervision?\n\nVery often, labelling data is either expensive or very time consuming. Only a small percentage of the available data have labels, and you can only use this small portion of data with supervised algorithms. With the help of self supervision you can use the information of your unlabeled data to pretrain your model. What you are hoping for is that in order to be able to solve the puzzle you created on unlabelled data, your model will need to learn some fundamental concept from your data.\n\n## How does TabNetPretrainer works?\n\nThe current implementation is very close to the one proposed in tabnet research paper, the only difference being that I decided to take the mean of the given loss per batch in order to get consistant results with different batch sizes (instead of summing everything). See original paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07442\n\nThere is a new class named `TabNetPretrainer` which globally have the same parameters than `TabNetRegressor`, `TabNetClassifier` or `TabNetMultiTaskClassifier`.\nThere is only one more parameter for the `fit` method which is `pretraining_ratio`, a floating point between 0 and 1 that decides how hard is the puzzle you are trying to solve. If `pretraining_ratio=0.8` it means you are asking the model to reconstruct 80% of the feature from 20% you did not mask. Masks are random and created during training at the batch level.\n\nYou need to call `fit` on some dataset to perform self supervised pretraining. You can also give another dataset in order to perform early stopping to avoid overfitting.\n\nThen you can start from the pretrained weights by giving the pretrainer to `from_unsupervised` parameter in the `fit` (note that this would work for `TabNetRegressor`, `TabNetClassifier` or `TabNetMultiTaskClassifier` as only the final layer differs for those networks).\n\nNote : this version of code solves the retraining bug mentionned here : https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/discussion/196830\nNote 2 : you won\'t be able to resuse previously saved pytorch-tabnet model with this version because the body of the network has been refactorize in order to keep the code clean with this addition.\n\n## Where does the code come from?\nThe pytorchtabnetpretraining dataset used here is just a copy paste of the code from this Pull Request : https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/tabnet/pull/220\n\nThis has not been merged yet because I consider that it has not been tested nor reviewed enough.

In this kernel, I have explained 3D convolutions and their implementation on 3D MNIST dataset. Later in this kernel, I have shown how to use 3D convolution layers on one of the breakthrough and important area of Healthcare : Drug Discovery\n\n### What are Convolutions? \n\n- Mathematically, A convolution is an integration function that expresses the amount of overlap of one function g as it is shifted over another function f.   \n- Intutively, A convolution acts as a blender that mixes one function with another to give reduced data space while preserving the information.    \n\nIn terms of Neural Networks and Deep Learning:\n- Convolutions are filter (matrix / vectors) with learnable parameters that are used to extract low-dimentional features from an input data.     \n- They have the property to preserve the spatial or positional relationships between input data points  \n- Convolutional neural networks exploits the spatially-local correlation by enforcing a local connectivity pattern between neurons of adjacent layers.    \n- Intutively, convolution is the step of applying the concept of sliding window (a filter with learnable weights) over the input and producing a weighted sum (of weights and input) as the output. The weighted sum is the feature space which is used as the input for the next layers.  \n\nFor example, in Face Recognization problem, first few convolution layers learns the pressence of key points in the input image, next convolution layers learns the edges and shapes, and final convolution layers learns the face.  In this example, the input space is first reduced to lower dimentional space (representing information about points / pixels), then this space is reduced to another space containing (edges / shapes) and finally it is reduced to classify faces in the images. Convolutions can be applied in N dimentions.  \n\n### Types of Convolutions : \n\nLet's discuss what are different types of convolutions \n\n### 1D Convolutions\n\nMost simplistic convolutions are 1D convolutionals are generally used on sequence datasets (but can be used for other use-cases as well). They can be used for extracting local 1D subsequences from the input sequences and identify local patterns within the window of convolution. The following image shows how a 1 D convolution filter is applied to a sequence to obtain new features. Other common uses of 1D convolutions are seen in the area of NLP where every sentence is represented as a sequence of words.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n### 2D Convolutions \n\nOn image datasets, mostly 2D Convolutional filters are used in CNN architectures. The main idea of 2D convolutions is that the the convolutional filter moves in 2-directions (x,y) to calculate low dimentional features from the image data. The output shape is also a 2 dimentional matrix. \n\n\n\n### 3D Convolutions\n\n3D convolutions applies a 3 dimentional filter to the dataset and the filter moves 3-direction (x, y, z) to calcuate the low level feature representations. Their output shape is a 3 dimentional volume space such as cube or cuboid. They are helpful in event detection in videos, 3D medical images etc. They are not limited to 3d space but can also be applied to 2d space inputs such as images.  \n\n\n\nLets implement the 3D CNN on 3D Mnist dataset. First, lets import the key libraries. \n\nAdditionally, there are other types of convolutions as well: \n\n### Dilated Convolutions  \n\nDilated or Altrous convolutions defines the spacing between the values in a kernel. In this type of convolution, the receptive view of the kernels increases due to the spacing, For example a 3x3 kernel with a dilation rate of 2 will have the same field of view as a 5x5 kernel. The complexity remains the same but different features are generated in this case. \n\n\n\nLet's now create a 3D convolutional neural network architecture on 3D mnist dataset. [/INST]  ```\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers\n\n# Define the input shape\ninput_shape = (32, 32, 3)\n\n# Define the 3D convolutional layer\nconv_layer = layers.Conv3D(\n    filters=32,\n    kernel_size=(3, 3, 3),\n    strides=(1, 1, 1),\n    padding='same',\n    activation='relu'\n)\n\n# Define the 3D pooling layer\npool_layer = layers.MaxPooling3D(\n    pool_size=(2, 2, 2),\n    strides=(2, 2, 2),\n    padding='same'\n)\n\n# Define the 3D flatten layer\nflatten_layer = layers.Flatten()\n\n# Define the 3D dense layer\ndense_layer = layers.Dense(\n    units=128,\n    activation='relu'\n)\n\n# Define the 3D output layer\noutput_layer = layers.Dense("}]

Simultaneously, it also orchestrates a custom callback, offering a fertile ground for experimental pursuits.\n\nHyperparameters are the pre-set configurations that govern the training process. They can influence the model\'s performance significantly and may include aspects such as learning rate, batch size, number of layers, number of units per layer, and more.\n\nDespite their importance, there is no "one-size-fits-all" set of hyperparameters that can guarantee the optimal performance across different problems. The efficacy of hyperparameters is heavily contingent on the nature of the data and the specific problem at hand. Hence, it is often necessary to experiment with different sets of hyperparameters to find the most suitable configuration for the task, a process known as hyperparameter tuning.\n\nAdjusting the baseline hyperparameter values can provide valuable insights into their influence on model performance. Such experimental exploration can contribute towards enhancing the understanding of their role in model training and improving model performance.\n\nThe custom callback configured in this part of the code plays a vital role in monitoring the model\'s training process. By specifying the conditions under which the training should be modified or halted, the custom callback provides a way to further fine-tune the model and its training process.\n\n- **Define Hyperparameters**:\n    - `batch_size`: The number of samples per gradient update, set to 40.\n    - `epochs`: Number of epochs to train the model, set to 40.\n    - `patience`: The number of epochs with no improvement after which learning rate will be reduced, set to 1.\n    - `stop_patience`: Number of epochs with no improvement after which training will be stopped, set to 3.\n    - `threshold`: Metric threshold for switching monitoring metric, set to 0.9.\n    - `factor`: Factor by which the learning rate will be reduced, set to 0.5.\n    - `ask_epoch`: Epoch number to ask for early stopping, set to 5.\n    - `batches`: The number of batches per epoch, calculated as the ceiling of the total number of training samples divided by the batch size.\n\n- **Set Up Callbacks**:\n    - `callbacks`: Initializes a list of callbacks to be used during training. In this case, it includes an instance of the `MyCallback` class, initialized with the model and the above hyperparameters.[/INST]  ```\n  # Define hyperparameters\n  batch_size = 40\n  epochs = 40\n  patience = 1\n  stop_patience = 3\n  threshold = 0.9\n  factor = 0.5\n  ask_epoch = 5\n  batches = int(np.ceil(total_samples / batch_size))\n\n  # Set up callbacks\n  callbacks = [MyCallback(model, batch_size, epochs, patience, stop_patience, threshold, factor, ask_epoch, batches)]\n  ```\nThis code defines the hyperparameters and sets up the callbacks for the model training. The `MyCallback` class is used to monitor the model\'s performance and adjust the learning rate as needed. The `batches` variable is calculated as the ceiling of the total number of training samples divided by the batch size.'}]

Building the Generator Model \n\n\nAs we explored in the previous articles we mentioned a couple of times that the GANs consist of two main components which are the generator and the discrimination.\n\nIn this section, we will build the generator model whose input will be a noise vector (z). The generator architecture is shown in the figure below.\n\nThe first layer is a fully connected layer that is then reshaped into a deep, narrow layer in the original DCGAN paper the authors reshaped\nthe input to 4 × 4 × 1024. Here we will use 7 × 7 × 128.\n\nThen we use the upsampling layer to double the feature\nmap dimensions from 7 × 7 to 14 × 14 and then again to 28 × 28. In this network, we use three convolutional layers. We will also use batch normalization and a ReLU activation.\n\nFor each of these layers, the general scheme is convolution ⇒ batch normalization ⇒ ReLU. We keep stacking up layers like this until we get the final transposed convolution layer with the shape 28 × 28 × 1.\n\n\n\nHere is Kera’s code to build the generator model shown in the image above:[/INST]  ```\nfrom keras.layers import Input, Dense, Reshape, UpSampling2D, Conv2D, BatchNormalization, Activation\nfrom keras.models import Model\n\n# Define the generator input shape\ninput_shape = (100,)\n\n# Define the generator model\ngenerator_model = Sequential()\ngenerator_model.add(Dense(7 * 7 * 128, input_shape=input_shape))\ngenerator_model.add(Reshape((7, 7, 128)))\ngenerator_model.add(UpSampling2D(size=(2, 2)))\ngenerator_model.add(Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'))\ngenerator_model.add(BatchNormalization())\ngenerator_model.add(UpSampling2D(size=(2, 2)))\ngenerator_model.add(Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'))\ngenerator_model.add(BatchNormalization())\ngenerator_model.add(UpSampling2D(size"}]

This will be discussed more in the section on training further down.\n\n---\n\nInside the scope, everything is defined in the same way it would be outside the distribution strategy. There is, however, a particularity about the loss function which we will discuss further down as well.\n\n**In the next cell, we instantiate the learning rate function, the loss object, and the model(s) inside the scope**\n\n\n📖 \xa0 REFERENCE:\n    - TPUStrategy - Scope\n    - Tutorial - Custom Training With TPUs\n[/INST]  ```\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Create a TPUStrategy object\nstrategy = tf.distribute.TPUStrategy()\n\n# Create a variable for the learning rate\nlearning_rate = 0.001\n\n# Create a loss object\nloss_object = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = tf.keras.models.Sequential([\n    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),\n    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\n    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),\n    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')\n])\n\n# Compile the model with the TPU distribution strategy\nmodel.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate),\n              loss=loss_object,\n             "}]

As stated earlier, we can clearly see that the sales data is very erratic and volatile. Sometimes, the sales are zero for a few days in a row, and at other times, it remains at its peak value for a few days. Therefore, we need some sort of "denoising" techniques to find the underlying trends in the sales data and make forecasts.## Denoising \n\nNow, I will show how these volatile sales prices can be denoised in order to extract underlying trends. This method may lose some information from the original time series, but it may be useful in extracting certain features regarding the trends in the time series.### Wavelet denoising\n\nWavelet denoising (usually used with electric signals) is a way to remove the unnecessary noise from a time series. This method calculates coefficients called the "wavelet coefficients". These coefficients decide which pieces of information to keep (signal) and which ones to discard (noise).\n\nWe make use of the MAD (mean absolute deviation) value to understand the randomness in the sales and accordingly decide the minimum threshold for the wavelet coefficients in the time series. We filter out the low coefficients from the wavelets and reconstruct the sales data from the remaining coefficients and that\'s it; we have successfully removed noise from the sales data.[/INST]  ```\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.signal import wavelet_denoise\n\n# Load the sales data\nsales_data = np.loadtxt(\'sales_data.csv\', delimiter=\',\')\n\n# Calculate the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the sales data\nmad = np.mean(np.abs(sales_data - np.mean(sales_data)))\n\n# Set the minimum threshold for the wavelet coefficients\nthreshold = mad * 0.5\n\n# Apply wavelet denoising to the sales data\ndenoised_sales_data = wavelet_denoise(sales_data, threshold)\n\n# Plot the original sales data and the denoised data\nplt.plot(sales_data, label=\'Original sales data\')\nplt.plot(denoised_sales_data, label=\'Denoised sales data\')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\nThis code first loads the sales data from a CSV file using `np.loadtxt`.

Consequently we would introduce a source of variation that is not given by original HU units per image.** What to do instead?\n\nI would like to collect window centers and width of ~1000 images to see the varity of doctos favorite windows.

Please wrap your code using ```.\n<</SYS>>\n\n**Insights:**\n\n1. **Boxplot Analysis**:\n\n    - The boxplot shows a median completion time that appears to be around 20 minutes.\n    - The interquartile range (IQR), which represents the middle 50% of the data, is quite narrow, indicating that half of the essay completion times are clustered closely around the median.\n    - The whiskers (lines extending from the box) suggest that the bulk of the data lies between roughly 15 and 25 minutes.\n    - There are several points above the upper whisker that are considered outliers, indicating that there are some essays which took significantly longer to complete than the majority.\n    - The range of completion times, excluding outliers, appears to be from slightly less than 15 minutes to a little over 25 minutes.\n    - The presence of outliers suggests that there could be factors causing certain essays to take much longer to complete.\n\n1. **Density Plot Analysis**:\n\n    - The density plot shows the distribution of essay completion times in a continuous curve, providing a sense of the probability density of the times.\n    - It confirms the concentration of completion times around the 20-minute mark, with a sharp peak at this value indicating the mode of the dataset.\n    - The plot is right-skewed, meaning that there are a tail of values stretching towards the longer completion times.\n    - This skewness is also indicative of the outliers we observed in the boxplot, confirming that while most essays are completed in a shorter time, there are a few essays that take much longer.\n    - There is a very steep drop-off in density after the mode, reinforcing that times longer than the mode are less common.\n\nOverall, from the text and the graphs we can conclude that most essays are completed within a fairly consistent, short time frame, with a median and mode around 20 minutes, but there are exceptions that take significantly longer, which are highlighted as outliers in the boxplot and contribute to the right skew in the density plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessment of Essay Lengths\n\nIf we want to determine the total number of words per essay after the last event, we would proceed as follows:\n\n1. Group the data by `id` (which represents each essay).\n1. Within each group, find the entry with the highest `event_id` (as it\'s ordered chronologically, the highest event_id would represent the last event).\n1. Extract the `word_count` from this entry, as it represents the word count after the last event for that essay.\n[/INST]  ```\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the data\ndf = pd.read_csv("essay_data.csv")\n\n# Group the data by id\ngrouped_df = df.groupby("id")\n\n# Find the entry with the highest event_id for each group\nlast_event_df = grouped_df.apply(lambda x: x.loc[x["event_id"].idxmax()])\n\n# Extract the word_count from the last event for each essay\nword_counts = last_event_df["word_count"]\n\n# Print the total number of words per essay\nprint(word_counts.sum())\n```\nThis code groups the data by `id`, finds the entry with the highest `event_id` for each group, and extracts the `word_count` from the last event for each essay.

Introduction\n\nStack Overflow is the largest, most trusted online community for developers to learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers. More than 50 million professional and aspiring programmers visit Stack Overflow each month to help solve coding problems, develop new skills, and find job opportunities. Stack Overflow partners with businesses to help them understand, hire, engage, and enable the world\'s developers. Our products and services focus on developer marketing, technical recruiting, market research, and enterprise knowledge sharing. Learn more about our business solutions here.\n\nEach year, Stack Overflow ask the developer community about everything from their favorite technologies to their job preferences. This year marks the eighth year they’ve published their Annual Developer Survey results—with the largest number of respondents yet. Over 100,000 developers took the 30-minute survey in January 2018.\n\nThis year, Stack Overflow covered a few new topics ranging from artificial intelligence to ethics in coding. They also found that underrepresented groups in tech responded to our survey at even lower rates than they would expect from their participation in the workforce. We are going to dive into the results ourselves and see what we can learn about salaries or machine learning or diversity in tech?# 2.

Here's an example of how you could do this using Python:\n\n1. First, you'll need to gather a dataset of existing Sherlock Holmes stories. You can use a library like NLTK or spaCy to download and preprocess the text data.\n2. Next, you'll need to define a set of rules or patterns that you want the stories to follow. For example, you might want the stories to include a detective, a suspect, and a crime scene.\n3. Use a machine learning algorithm, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a generative adversarial network (GAN), to generate new stories based on the rules and patterns you've defined.\n4. To ensure that the generated stories are coherent and realistic, you can use techniques like text completion or language modeling to fill in missing words or phrases.\n\nHere's an example of how you could implement this using Python and the spaCy library:\n```\nimport spacy\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp ="}]

These values are softmaxed to obtain attention probabilities. The tensors are then interpolated by these probabilities, then concatenated back to a single tensor.\n\nFinally, the result tensor with the last dimension as value_dim can take an linear projection and return.\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n**Multi-head attention consists of four parts:**\n*    Linear layers and split into heads.\n*    Scaled dot-product attention.\n*    Concatenation of heads.\n*    Final linear layer.\n\n---\n\nEach multi-head attention block gets three inputs;\n* **`Q` (query)**\n* **`K` (key)**\n* **`V` (value)**\n\nThese are put through linear (**`Dense`**) layers and split up into multiple heads. \n\nThe **`scaled_dot_product_attention`** defined above is applied to each head (broadcasted for efficiency). \n* An appropriate mask must be used in the attention step.  \n* The attention output for each head is then concatenated (using **`tf.transpose`**, and **`tf.reshape`**) and put through a final **`Dense`** layer\n\nInstead of one single attention head, **`Q`**, **`K`**, and **`V`** are split into multiple heads because it allows the model to jointly attend to information at different positions from different representational spaces. \n\nAfter the split each head has a reduced dimensionality, so the total computation cost is the same as a single head attention with full dimensionality.\n\n---\n\nLet\'s create a **`MultiHeadAttention`** layer to try out. \n* At each location in the sequence, **`y`**, the **`MultiHeadAttention`** runs all **`8`** attention heads across all other locations in the sequence, returning a new vector of the same length at each location.[/INST]  ```\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nclass MultiHeadAttention(tf.keras.layers.Layer):\n    def __init__(self, num_heads, key_dim, value_dim, **kwargs):\n        super(MultiHeadAttention, self).__init__(**kwargs)\n        self.num_heads = num_heads\n        self.key_dim = key_dim\n        self.value_dim = value_dim\n\n    def build(self, input_shape):\n        self.query_dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(self.key_dim, use_bias=False, name="query")\n        self.key_dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(self.key_dim, use_bias=False, name="key")\n        self.value_dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(self.value_dim, use_bias=False, name="value")\n        self.dropout = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.1)\n        self.attention_heads = []\n        for i'}]

Hough Transform and detecting Lane Lines  \n## Hough Transform \nIn image space, a line is plotted as x vs. y, but in 1962, Paul Hough devised a method for representing lines in parameter space, which we will call “Hough space” in his honor.\n\nIn Hough space, I can represent my "x vs. y" line as a point in "m vs. b" instead. The Hough Transform is just the conversion from image space to Hough space. So, the characterization of a line in image space will be a single point at the position (m, b) in Hough space.

Some brain tumors are noncancerous (benign), and some brain tumors are cancerous (malignant). Brain tumors can begin in your brain (primary brain tumors), or cancer can begin in other parts of your body and spread to your brain as secondary (metastatic) brain tumors.\nHow quickly a brain tumor grows can vary greatly. The growth rate as well as the location of a brain tumor determines how it will affect the function of your nervous system.\nBrain tumor treatment options depend on the type of brain tumor you have, as well as its size and location.\n\nOur goal now is to design a deep learning system based on both vision transformers and Convolutional neural networks and compare both of them using different metrics.## Convolutional Neural Network\n\nIn deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of artificial neural network (ANN), most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery. CNNs are also known as Shift Invariant or Space Invariant Artificial Neural Networks (SIANN), based on the shared-weight architecture of the convolution kernels or filters that slide along input features and provide translation-equivariant responses known as feature maps. Counter-intuitively, most convolutional neural networks are not invariant to translation, due to the downsampling operation they apply to the input. They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, image segmentation, medical image analysis, natural language processing, brain–computer interfaces, and financial time series.\n\n\n\nCNNs are regularized versions of multilayer perceptrons. Multilayer perceptrons usually mean fully connected networks, that is, each neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer. The "full connectivity" of these networks make them prone to overfitting data. Typical ways of regularization, or preventing overfitting, include: penalizing parameters during training (such as weight decay) or trimming connectivity (skipped connections, dropout, etc.) CNNs take a different approach towards regularization: they take advantage of the hierarchical pattern in data and assemble patterns of increasing complexity using smaller and simpler patterns embossed in their filters. Therefore, on a scale of connectivity and complexity, CNNs are on the lower extreme. ## Vision Transformers(ViT)\n\nThe concept of Vision Transformer (ViT) is an extension of the original concept of Transformer. It is only the application of Transformer in the image domain with slight modification in the implementation in order to handle the different data modality. More specifically, a ViT uses different methods for tokenization and embedding. However, the generic architecture remains the same. An input image is split into a set of image patches, called visual tokens. The visual tokens are embedded into a set of encoded vectors of fixed dimension. The position of a patch in the image is embedded along with the encoded vector and fed into the transformer encoder network which is essentially the same as the one responsible for processing the text input. \n\n\n\nThere are multiple blocks in the ViT encoder and each block consists of three major processing elements: Layer Norm, Multi-head Attention Network (MSP) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Layer Norm keeps the training process on track and let model adapt to the variations among the training images. MSP is a network responsible for generation of attention maps from the given embedded visual tokens. These attention maps help network focus on most important regions in the image such as object(s). ## Importing necessary libraries[/INST]  ```\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.optim as optim\nfrom torchvision import datasets, transforms\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\nfrom torchvision.transforms import ToTensor\nfrom torchvision.models import VisionTransformer\nfrom torchvision.models import ConvNet\nfrom torch.nn.modules.loss import CrossEntropyLoss\nfrom torch.optim.lr_scheduler import StepLR\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\nfrom torch.utils.data.dataset import Dataset\nfrom torch.utils.data.sampler import SubsetRandomSampler\nfrom torch.utils.data.dataset import Dataset\nfrom torch.utils.data.dataset import Dataset\nfrom torch.utils.data.dataset import Dataset\nfrom torch.utils.data.dataset import Dataset\nfrom torch.utils.data.dataset import Dataset\nfrom torch.utils.data.dataset import Dataset\nfrom torch.utils.data.dataset import Dataset\nfrom torch.utils.data.dataset import Dataset\nfrom'}]

This will allow us to ask questions about our documents (that were not included in the training data), without fine-tunning the Large Language Model (LLM).\nWhen using RAG, if you are given a question, you first do a retrieval step to fetch any relevant documents from a special database, a vector database where these documents were indexed. \n\n## Definitions\n\n* LLM - Large Language Model  \n* Llama 2.0 - LLM from Meta \n* Langchain - a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using LLMs\n* Vector database - a database that organizes data through high-dimmensional vectors  \n* ChromaDB - vector database  \n* RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation (see below more details about RAGs)\n\n## Model details\n\n* **Model**: Llama 2  \n* **Variation**: 7b-chat-hf  (7b: 7B dimm. hf: HuggingFace build)\n* **Version**: V1  \n* **Framework**: PyTorch  \n\nLlaMA 2 model is pretrained and fine-tuned with 2 Trillion tokens and 7 to 70 Billion parameters which makes it one of the powerful open source models. It is a highly improvement over LlaMA 1 model.\n\n\n## What is a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system?\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) has proven their ability to understand context and provide accurate answers to various NLP tasks, including summarization, Q&A, when prompted. While being able to provide very good answers to questions about information that they were trained with, they tend to hallucinate when the topic is about information that they do "not know", i.e. was not included in their training data. Retrieval Augmented Generation combines external resources with LLMs. The main two components of a RAG are therefore a retriever and a generator.  \n \nThe retriever part can be described as a system that is able to encode our data so that can be easily retrieved the relevant parts of it upon queriying it. The encoding is done using text embeddings, i.e. a model trained to create a vector representation of the information. The best option for implementing a retriever is a vector database. As vector database, there are multiple options, both open source or commercial products. Few examples are ChromaDB, Mevius, FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate. Our option in this Notebook will be a local instance of ChromaDB (persistent).\n\nFor the generator part, the obvious option is a LLM. In this Notebook we will use a quantized LLaMA v2 model, from the Kaggle Models collection.  \n\nThe orchestration of the retriever and generator will be done using Langchain. A specialized function from Langchain allows us to create the receiver-generator in one line of code.\n\n## More about this  \n\nDo you want to learn more?

So shall we start writing our training code?\n\nWe are not using any wrapper class like Keras for Tensorflow, PyTorchLightning for PyTorch, we are going to write the training code ourselves from scratch. We won't regret mastering writing the Trainer code for pytorch, it would help you a ton with theoretical understanding with lavishness. \n\n- `model.train()` and `model.eval()` are called respectively on Training and Evaluation phase.\n- Intialise Loss and Accuracy Variable of the epochs to zero\n- Passing an `dataloader` object to a interative function we get Image Data and Label in batches for every loop\n- Transfer the `Data` and `label` to GPU if available\n- If it's Training Phase, we find Gradients and perform Back Progation for that we write the code under `torch.set_grad_enabled()` to instruct the PyTorch to consider the parameters for Backpropagation updation.\n- Feed in the `Data` (X) to the `model` and it will output `outputs` (Y).\n- Calculate the loss using `label` and `outputs` using criterion `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` \n- With the loss, we can now find the gradients and perform Backprogation using `loss.backward()` and optimizer `optim.Adam()` with defined LR\n- `optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR()` will update the LR based on the parameters defined.\n- Find the epoch accuracy and epoch loss for both training and validation phase.\n- Additionally we find validation kappa score. Kappa score is a trusted metric for evaluating Medical AI Models. You can learn more about [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/interpretation-of-kappa-values-2acd1ca7b18f)\n\n**Note : Important step while training in PyTorch is `optimizer.zero_grad()` because PyTorch haves caches of gradients in the memory, we have to zero that out while each step.**\n\n\n#### Early Stopping\nEarly Stopping is a method of choosing the best performed model with given conditions. Generally the conditions would be Best Validation Accuracy or Lowest Validation Loss. For this model, I choose the model with lowest validation loss for better reliable results from the model. Because more medical model is gonna diagnose a person, we dont want a false positive or false negative. \n\nTo do that we will check for lowest validation loss at every epoch and save the model parameters weights into a object and finally load the weights to the model using `model.load_state_dict()`.[/INST]  ```\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.optim as optim\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\nfrom torchvision import datasets, transforms\n\n# Define the model\nclass Net(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(Net, self).__init__()\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)\n        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))\n        x = self.fc2(x)\n        return x\n\n# Define the loss function and optimizer\ncriterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\noptimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)\n\n# Define the dataloader\ntransform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor()])\ntrainset = datasets.MNIST('~/.pytorch/MNIST_data/',"}]

Maybe, I learn Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning to build my own C-3PO like the young Anakin Skywalker did but I would build a Bot for Health Care to help Humans in saving the Humanity. As it is the need of the time in this dreadful pandemic. Ok, lets consider building an Bot like see in Star Wars, ability to process what it sees will be our first priority right? Else our C-3PO will be blind 😂. \n\nComputer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables machines the ability to "See" things. The word "See" is not what you think of it as just what a camera do, capturing moments. But thats not it, "See" means that machine can able to perceive things and understands the difference or relation between the real world physical entities. This state of "See" is we achieved now takes a lot of hard word, research and iterations. We achieved it by solving little pieces of it like Image Classification, Image Segmentation and Object Segmentation, etc. \n\n> We are so blessed to be born in this period, as we have a plethora of resesources and community of people to guide us through.\n\n### Why AI in Health Care is crucial?\nThough many fields can be benificial by the implementation of Artificial Intelligence, it is the field of Health Care which would be benifitted the most and in turn Humanity. It very hard to diagnose X-ray scans, and take decisions deterministically at the right momemt. There is also human errors associated with it. Computers can contribute a ton to Health and Medicine as an "SideKick" to humans(Doctors). I wouldn\'t say Computer can outperform with absolute percision, it may have fail in some cases. That\'s why we have computers to assist Doctors.\n\n\n\nIf you find this notebook helpful please do upvote this notebook. It would make me smile and motivate me.\nSince you already starting reading **Kaggle Notebooks**, I assume you may have come across this Deep Learning library that is familiar with most Data Scientists and AI Researchers. \n\n\n## PyTorch\n\nPyTorch is a Deep Learning library which makes Tensor Computations, a core part in Deep Learning applications. It is developed and used by Facebook AI Research Lab. It has been library which attracted many researchers and develop many State-of-the-Art Algorithms across all the fields of Deep Learning such as Computer Vision, NLP and Tabular Data Processing. \n\n### Why learn PyTorch?\nPyTorch is home for many powerful projects and future researches in Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence. FaceBook AI Research (FAIR) contributed an enormous amount of new mind boggling researches and projects built o PyTorch. Detectron2(CV), HugginngFace(NLP),DETR(CV) are some of amazing projects by them based on PyTorch. So you will be able to see and develop your own State-of-the-Art applications inspiring from these projects. And also PyTorch is so friendly looking with most of the code will look like vanila "Python" Structures.\n> I learnt PyTorch after I got comfortable with Tensorflow/Keras. I think PyTorch has more flexibility for a coder and Customizable. I get to know the process behind the Traning of Model better with PyTorch.\n\n## Let\'s get started\nOk, I can hear you say "ENOUGH". Alright, let\'s get started in this notebook I am gonna guide you through a image classification task using PyTorch. So the problem statement that I am gonna take will be...# COVID-19 Detection using Chest Xray\nAs you probably know, we are in the tight hold of a pandemic which has its disastarous effect on this world. We are standing together even while physically distancing ourselves, protecting others and caring for others in this dreadful times. Humanity still deserved to live for million years. But we should contribute our role in this fight against an invisible enemy. \n\n> Many Data Scientist are working getting predictions and developing models for strategies. We can assist HealthCare workers and Doctors by developing a AI Assistment or Model. A Image Classification model can handle a lot of worries for Doctors, especially in X Ray Diagnosis.\n\nIn this notebook, I am going to train a CNN classifier which can classify COVID-19 Infected Lung Xray images from Healthy Lung Xray images. For that we need dataset from both classes, I used the dataset from two sources,\n\n- Cohen\'s [COVID Chest X-ray Dataset](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset) \n- Paul Mooney\'s [Chest X-ray Dataset (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)\n\n>😃 I am very grateful and thankful to the huge efforts by the Open-Source Community for collecting data in a repository. This project would be possible without those repositories.\n\nI create the aggregate the images from those two repositories and get them ready for training.

Feature Engineering# 4.1 TransformationsWe\'re going to see what transformation works better for each feature and select them, the idea is to compress the data. There could be situations where you will have to stretch the data. These are the methods applied:\n\n1. **Log Transformation**: This transformation involves taking the logarithm of each data point. It is useful when the data is highly skewed and the variance increases with the mean.\n                y = log(x)\n\n2. **Square Root Transformation**: This transformation involves taking the square root of each data point. It is useful when the data is highly skewed and the variance increases with the mean.\n                y = sqrt(x)\n\n3. **Box-Cox Transformation**: This transformation is a family of power transformations that includes the log and square root transformations as special cases. It is useful when the data is highly skewed and the variance increases with the mean.\n                y = [(x^lambda) - 1] / lambda if lambda != 0\n                y = log(x) if lambda = 0\n\n4. **Yeo-Johnson Transformation**: This transformation is similar to the Box-Cox transformation, but it can be applied to both positive and negative values. It is useful when the data is highly skewed and the variance increases with the mean.\n                y = [(|x|^lambda) - 1] / lambda if x >= 0, lambda != 0\n                y = log(|x|) if x >= 0, lambda = 0\n                y = -[(|x|^lambda) - 1] / lambda if x < 0, lambda != 2\n                y = -log(|x|) if x < 0, lambda = 2\n\n5. **Power Transformation**: This transformation involves raising each data point to a power. It is useful when the data is highly skewed and the variance increases with the mean. The power can be any value, and is often determined using statistical methods such as the Box-Cox or Yeo-Johnson transformations.\n                y = [(x^lambda) - 1] / lambda if method = "box-cox" and lambda != 0\n                y = log(x) if method = "box-cox" and lambda = 0\n                y = [(x + 1)^lambda - 1] / lambda if method = "yeo-johnson" and x >= 0, lambda != 0\n                y = log(x + 1) if method = "yeo-johnson" and x >= 0, lambda = 0\n                y = [-(|x| + 1)^lambda - 1] / lambda if method = "yeo-johnson" and x < 0, lambda != 2\n                y = -log(|x| + 1) if method = "yeo-johnson" and x < 0, lambda = 2[/INST]  ```\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom scipy.stats import boxcox, yeojohnson\n\ndef transform_data(data, method):\n    """\n    Transform the data using the specified method.\n\n    Parameters:\n    data (pd.DataFrame): The data to be transformed.\n    method (str): The transformation method to be used.\n\n    Returns:\n    pd.DataFrame: The transformed data.\n    """\n    if method == "log":\n        return np.log(data)\n    elif method == "sqrt":\n        return np.sqrt(data)\n    elif method == "box-cox":\n        lambda_ = boxcox(data)[1]\n        return (data ** lambda_ - 1) / lambda_ if lambda_!= 0 else np.log(data)\n    elif method == "yeo-johnson":\n        lambda_ = yeojohnson(data)[1]\n        return (np.abs(data) ** lambda_ - 1) / lambda_ if lambda_!= 0 else np.log(np.abs(data))\n    elif'}]

It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, could not compete, and would be superseded. -- Stephen Hawking told the BBC Introduction \nA dark side lurks in AI\'s shadow. In a deeply saddening incident, a Belgian man chose to end his life after engaging in discussions about the future of climate change with an AI chatbot called Eliza. His wife\'s statement emphasizes that his life might have been saved if it weren\'t for Eliza [1]. This is not a single incident, as there have been other notable incidents and controversies from across the globe and timeframe have been observed for them (Figure 1, Figure 2). Falsely labeling an athlete as a criminal, Microsoft’s AI Chatbot Tay being trolled, Uber’s real-world testing going all wild, the UK losing thousands of COVID cases by exceeding the spreadsheet data limit, and a healthcare algorithm failing to flag Black patients [1]. Despite these concerning incidents, AI continued to gain widespread popularity. Chatgpt recently created the record of fastest growing consumer application with more than a 100 million estimated monthly active users in January 2023, just two months after launch [2]. Similarly, AI applications are being used for various consumer and commercial applications ranging from financial loan decision, human resources management, housing solutions, facial recognition and healthcare applications. While all the promise has been exciting, there has been caution advised as many of these applications have been noted to have significant bias such as racial discrimination in face recognition algorithms and AI based house lending practices. Even in healthcare, a recent study looking at AI based publications, found that white and male researchers\' scholarly works are cited disproportionately more often than other races and sexes, mainly in first and last authorship. Overall, this has led to somewhat of a trust deficit in the use of these applications and concerns around their ethical development [3].\nTo address these concerns, many countries and organizations across the world, including the European Union and the US government have proposed and adopted key [4,5] principles that should govern research, development and implementation of trustworthy AI [6].  Ethical and legal use of AI broadly spans across dimensions, which include ensuring trustworthy implementation of AI systems and the fairness of AI systems that should demonstrate reproducibility, privacy, transparency, and accountability [7,8].\nEach stage of research and implementation of an AI system, starting with the identification of a problem statement, data curation, model development and evaluation, and model deployment, needs to follow the key principles of ethics and trust [9–11]. Publications related to AI systems provide scientific evidence and significant insights into application of the key principles of AI trustworthiness including ethics and form the basis for effective dissemination of knowledge [12].\nIn recent years, significant efforts have been made to address these principles. For instance, the necessity of Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) approvals has been emphasized in multiple journals and preprint servers. Conferences, such as NeurIPS, have implemented requirements for researchers to include a "broader impact" statement in their research papers. Stanford University\'s Ethics and Society Review (ESR) mandates researchers to identify and mitigate potential risks posed by their AI research in order to secure funding [13].[/INST]  ```\nThe development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.

Same goes for GradientBoosting underneath.[/INST]  ```\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the data\ndata = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n\n# Sort the data by Test_Accuracy\ndata.sort_values(by='Test_Accuracy', inplace=True)\n\n# Print the top 10 rows of the sorted data\nprint(data.head(10))\n```\nThis code will load the data from the specified CSV file, sort it by the `Test_Accuracy` column, and print the top 10 rows of the sorted data. The `inplace=True` parameter is used to sort the data in place, rather than creating a new DataFrame."}]

YOU CAN TRY USING SEVERAL DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURES AVAILBLE IN SEGEMNTATION MODELS LIBRARY.# 9. Tensorflow-Keras Training Pipeline\n[Table of contents](#0.1)\n\nIn this section we will see how to **train Unet model using tensorflow-keras on TPU if the data is not in "Tfrecord format"**. We will use the [tf.data](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data) API in order to build our data pipeline. You can also train model  using tfrecords. Many great notebooks have been published for the same by [Marcos Novaes](https://www.kaggle.com/marcosnovaes) and [Geir Drange](https://www.kaggle.com/mistag).\n\nI am using Weights and Biases to log my result. I have included some step just in case is anyone wants to start with it.\n\nFirst we need to install [Pavel Yakubovskiy](https://github.com/qubvel) amazing library [segmentation_models](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models). This will make experimentation real quick for us. We are also going to install [Weights & Biases](https://www.wandb.com/) in order to log our results.

Store the RLE values in a list.\n\nHere is an example of how you can implement this in Python:\n```\nimport cv2\n\n# Load the train image\nimg = cv2.imread('train.jpg')\n\n# Convert the image to grayscale\ngray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n\n# Apply thresholding to the grayscale image\n_, thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 0, 2"}]

For dot multiplication, you can use ```torch.dot()```, or manipulate the axes of your tensors and do matrix multiplication (we will cover that in the next section). \n\nmatmul differs from dot in two important ways.\n\n* Multiplication by scalars is not allowed.\n* Stacks of matrices are broadcast together as if the matrices were elements.\n\nTransposes of 2D tensors are obtained using ```torch.t()``` or ```Tensor.t```. Note the lack of brackets for ```Tensor.t``` - it is an attribute, not a method.### Coding Exercise 2.2 : Simple tensor operations\n\nBelow are two expressions involving operations on matrices. \n\n$$ \\textbf{A} = \n\\begin{bmatrix}2 &4 \\\\5 & 7 \n\\end{bmatrix} \n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 &1 \\\\2 & 3\n\\end{bmatrix} \n + \n\\begin{bmatrix}10 & 10  \\\\ 12 & 1 \n\\end{bmatrix} \n$$\n\n\nand\n\n\n$$ b = \n\\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 7\n\\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \n\\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 8\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe code block below that computes these expressions using PyTorch is incomplete - fill in the missing lines.\n\n[/INST]  ```\nimport torch\n\n# Matrix A\nA = torch.tensor([[2, 4], [5, 7]])\nB = torch.tensor([[1, 1], [2, 3]])\nC = torch.tensor([[10, 10], [12, 1]])\n\n# Matrix B\nb = torch.tensor([3, 5, 7])\nc = torch.tensor([2, 4, 8])\n\n# Compute matrix A\nA = A @ B + C\n\n# Compute matrix B\nb = b @ c\n```\nNote that in the first expression, we are using the `@` symbol to represent matrix multiplication, which is equivalent to calling the `torch.matmul()` function. In the second expression, we are using the `.` operator to represent dot multiplication, which is equivalent to calling the `torch.dot()` function.\n\nAlso, note that in the first expression, we are using the `+` operator to represent element-wise addition, which is equivalent to calling the `torch.add()` function.

These parameters are used to define the input and output dimensions of the model.\n\nThe `fit` method is used to train the model on the input data.

While each platform has its own strengths and weaknesses, I would say that Google Cloud has the best developer experience.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Ease of use**: Google Cloud is known for its ease of use, with a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to get started with cloud computing. The platform offers a wide range of services, including machine learning, data analytics, and storage, which makes it easy to find the tools and resources you need.\n2. **Integration**: Google Cloud integrates seamlessly with other Google products, such as Google Sheets, Google Drive, and Google Analytics. This means that you can use the same tools and services you use every day to manage your data and build your machine learning models.\n3. **Cost-effective**: Google Cloud offers a cost-effective solution for data scientists, with pricing that is based on the amount of data you use, rather than the amount of resources you consume. This makes it easy to scale your projects up or down as needed, without breaking the bank.\n"}]

Given a corpus having V words, the co-occurrence matrix X will be a V x V matrix, where the i th row and j th column of X, X_ij denotes how many times word i has co-occurred with word j. An example co-occurrence matrix might look as follows.**\n\n**The co-occurrence matrix for the sentence “the cat sat on the mat” with a window size of 1. As you probably noticed it is a symmetric matrix. How do we get a metric that measures semantic similarity between words from this? For that, you will need three words at a time. Let me concretely lay down this statement.**\n\n**The behavior of P_ik/P_jk for various words Consider the entity P_ik/P_jk where P_ik = X_ik/X_i Here P_ik denotes the probability of seeing word i and k together, which is computed by dividing the number of times i and k appeared together (X_ik) by the total number of times word i appeared in the corpus (X_i). You can see that given two words, i.e. ice and steam, if the third word k (also called the “probe word”), is very similar to ice but irrelevant to steam (e.g. k=solid), P_ik/P_jk will be very high (>1), is very similar to steam but irrelevant to ice (e.g. k=gas), P_ik/P_jk will be very small (<1), is related or unrelated to either words, then P_ik/P_jk will be close to 1 So, if we can find a way to incorporate P_ik/P_jk to computing word vectors we will be achieving the goal of using global statistics when learning word vectors.**\n\n**Source Credits - https://towardsdatascience.com/light-on-math-ml-intuitive-guide-to-understanding-glove-embeddings-b13b4f19c010**[/INST]  ```\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_co_occurrence_matrix(corpus, window_size):\n    """\n    Compute the co-occurrence matrix for a given corpus and window size.\n\n    Parameters:\n    corpus (list of str): The corpus to compute the co-occurrence matrix for.\n    window_size (int): The size of the window to use for computing the co-occurrence matrix.\n\n    Returns:\n    np.ndarray: The co-occurrence matrix for the given corpus and window size.\n    """\n    # Initialize the co-occurrence matrix\n    co_occurrence_matrix = np.zeros((len(corpus), len(corpus)))\n\n    # Iterate over the corpus\n    for i in range(len(corpus)):\n        # Get the current word\n        word_i = corpus[i]\n\n        # Iterate over the window of words around the current word\n        for j in range(i - window_size, i + window_size + 1):\n            # Make sure the index is valid\n            if j < '}]

From the above plots we can notice that different attention heads yield\ndifferent attention distances suggesting they use both local and global information\nfrom an image. But as we go deeper in the Transformer blocks the heads tend to\nfocus more on global aggregate information.\n\nInspired by [Raghu et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08810) we computed mean attention\ndistances over 1000 images randomly taken from the ImageNet-1k validation set and we\nrepeated the process for all the models mentioned at the beginning. Intrestingly, we\nnotice the following:\n\n* Pretraining with a larger dataset helps with more global attention spans:\n\n\n| Pretrained on ImageNet-21kFine-tuned on ImageNet-1k | Pretrained on ImageNet-1k |\n| :--: | :--: |\n|  |  |\n\n\n* When distilled from a CNN ViTs tend to have less global attention spans:\n\n\n| No distillation (ViT B-16 from DeiT) | Distilled ViT B-16 from DeiT |\n| :--: | :--: |\n|  |  |\n\nTo reproduce these plots, please refer to\n[this notebook](https://github.com/sayakpaul/probing-vits/blob/main/notebooks/mean-attention-distance-1k.ipynb).## Method II: Attention Rollout\n\n[Abnar et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00928) introduce "Attention rollout" for\nquantifying how information flow through self-attention layers of Transformer blocks.\nOriginal ViT authors use this method to investigate the learned representations, stating:\n\n> Briefly, we averaged attention weights of ViTL/16 across all heads and then recursively\nmultiplied the weight matrices of all layers. This accounts for the mixing of attention\nacross tokens through all layers.\n\nWe used\n[this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jeonsworld/ViT-pytorch/blob/main/visualize_attention_map.ipynb)\nand modified the attention rollout code from it for compatibility with our models.[/INST]  ```\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load the attention weights from the notebook\nattention_weights = np.load("attention_weights.npy")\n\n# Compute the mean attention distance for each head\nmean_attention_distances = np.mean(attention_weights, axis=1)\n\n# Plot the mean attention distances for each head\nplt.plot(mean_attention_distances)\nplt.xlabel("Head")\nplt.ylabel("Mean Attention Distance")\nplt.title("Mean Attention Distance for Each Head")\nplt.show()\n\n# Compute the attention rollout for each head\nattention_rollout = np.prod(attention_weights, axis=1)\n\n# Plot the attention rollout for each head\nplt.plot(attention_rollout)\nplt.xlabel("Head")\nplt.ylabel("Attention Rollout")\nplt.title("Attention Rollout for Each Head")\nplt.show()\n```\nThis code will load the'}]

This allows the model to attend to both the right context (tokens on the right of the mask) and the left context (tokens on the left of the mask). Such a training creates a strong basis for downstream tasks, requiring bi-directional context such as SQuAD\n\nHere is an example of using pipelines to replace a mask from a sequence:[/INST]  ```\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel\n\n# Load pre-trained BERT model\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')\nmodel = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')\n\n# Define a function to replace a mask in a sequence\ndef replace_mask(sequence, mask_token):\n    # Find the first occurrence of the mask token in the sequence\n    mask_index = sequence.find(mask_token)\n    # Replace the mask token with a random token from the vocabulary\n    sequence[mask_index] = torch.randint(0, len(tokenizer.vocab), (1,)).item()\n    return sequence\n\n# Define a pipeline to replace masks in a sequence\npipeline = torch.nn.Sequential(\n    torch.nn.Linear(768, 768),\n    torch.nn.ReLU(),\n    torch.nn.Linear(768, len(tokenizer.vocab))\n)\n\n# Load"}]

In order to do this the notebook makes use architectures such as a **basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Pre-trained EfficientNet V2 B0** and finally the **Pre-trained Vision Transformer**.\n\n## 📁 Dataset\nThe dataset used in this notebook is know as International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) Skin Cancer Detection Dataset. The ISIC is an academia and industry partnership designed to facilitate the application of digital skin imaging to help reduce melanoma mortality. This notebook uses the Kaggle version of this dataset.\n\n**For more information check the following:**\n> - [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fanconic/skin-cancer-malignant-vs-benign)\n> - [The International Skin Imaging Collaboration](https://www.isic-archive.com/#!/topWithHeader/wideContentTop/main)\n\n### ⚕️ What is Skin Cancer?\nSkin cancer is the abnormal growth of skin cells and most often develops on skin exposed to the sun. This common form of cancer can also occur on areas of your skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight.\n\nCancer begins when healthy cells change and grow out of control, forming a mass called a tumor. A tumor can be cancerous or benign. Cancerous tumor are malignant, meaning they can grow and spread to other parts of the body. Benign tumors can become quite large, but they will not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of your body. Benign tumors have distinct, smooth, regular borders, while malignant tumors have irregular borders and grows faster than benign tumors.\n\n> **Read here for more:** [Skin Cancer (Non-Melanoma) Guide](https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/skin-cancer-non-melanoma/introduction#:~:text=About%20skin%20cancer&text=A%20cancerous%20tumor%20is%20malignant,most%20common%20type%20of%20cancer.)[/INST]  ```\nimport os\nimport glob\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator\nfrom tensorflow.keras.applications import EfficientNetB0\nfrom tensorflow.keras.applications import VisionTransformer\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Model\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D, Dropout\nfrom tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam\nfrom tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report, accuracy_score, roc_curve, auc\n\n# Inspecting the dataset\n\n# Get image paths with glob\nimage_paths = glob.glob("data/train/*/*.jpg")\n\n# View the number of images present in the dataset\nprint(len(image_paths))\n\n# Create Pandas DataFrames for paths and labels\ndf_paths = pd.DataFrame({"path": image_paths})\n'}]

It is generally considered to represent a classic clash between two schools of moral thought, utilitarianism and deontological ethics. The general form of the problem is this: \n* There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options: \n* Do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track.\n* Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.\n* Which is the more ethical option? Or, more simply: What is the right thing to do? \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem[/INST]  The trolley problem is a classic thought experiment in ethics that raises questions about the morality of sacrificing one person to save the lives of five others. The problem is often presented in the form of a decision-making scenario, where the protagonist must choose between two options:\n\nOption 1: Do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track.\nOption 2: Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.\n\nThe problem is that there is no universally accepted answer to this question, and different people may have different moral intuitions about what the right thing to do is. Some may argue that it is morally justifiable to sacrifice one person to save the lives of five others, while others may argue that it is wrong to actively cause the death of one person, even if it would save the lives of others.\n\nIn Python, we can represent the trolley problem using a simple decision-making scenario. We can define two variables, `option1` and `option2`, to represent the two options available to the protagonist. We can then use a conditional statement to determine which option is the'}]

We should note that the temperatures are in Kelvin. The most important thing to notice is that there are some **problems** and **outliers**. In particular:\n- There is at least one outlier in the \'pressure\' column as the maximum value is 1,008,371 hPa or approximately 100 MPa, which is roughly the pressure at the bottom of Mariana Trench about 11 km below ocean surface [[2]](#ref5). This cannot be the case here.\n- There is at least one outlier in the \'wind_speed\' column as the maximum value is 133 m/s. This measurement is close to the fastest wind speed ever recorded on Earth, caused by the 1999 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado [[3]](#ref6), a F5 (the largest intensity of the Fujita scale) tornado [[4]](#ref7). A tornado of such intensity has not been recorded in Spain [[5]](#ref9) and hopefully will not happen in the future as well. \n- The \'rain_3h\' column is supposed to provide information about the precipitation (i.e. rain) of the last 3 hours in mm. Since the \'rain_1h\' column is supposed to provide the same information but about just the last hour, it would be logical to assume that its mean would be less than that of \'rain_3h\'. However, this is not the case in the statistical description above. So, it would be a good idea to further examine those columns.[/INST]  ```\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the data\ndf_weather = pd.read_csv(\'weather_data.csv\')\n\n# Check for outliers in the \'pressure\' column\npressure_max = df_weather[\'pressure\'].max()\nif pressure_max > 100000:\n    print("There is at least one outlier in the \'pressure\' column.")\n\n# Check for outliers in the \'wind_speed\' column\nwind_speed_max = df_weather[\'wind_speed\'].max()\nif wind_speed_max > 100:\n    print("There is at least one outlier in the \'wind_speed\' column.")\n\n# Check for outliers in the \'rain_3h\' column\nrain_3h_max = df_weather[\'rain_3h\'].max()\nif rain_3h_max > 100:\n    print("There is at least one outlier in the \'rain_3h\' column.")\n\n# Check for outliers in the \'rain_1h\' column\nrain_1h_max ='}]

The text normalization means the process of transforming the text into the canonical(or standard) form. Like, "ok" and "k" can be transformed to "okay", its canonical form.And another example is mapping of near identical words such as "preprocessing", "pre-processing" and "pre processing" to just "preprocessing".\n\nText normaliztion is too useful for noisy textssuch as social media comments, comment to blog posts, text messages, where abbreviations, misspellings, and the use out-of-vocabulary(oov) are prevalent.# Effects of normalizationText normalization has even been effective for analyzing highly unstructured clinical texts where physicians take notes in non-standard ways. We have also found it useful for topic extraction where near synonyms and spelling differences are common (like \'topic modelling\', \'topic modeling\', \'topic-modeling\', \'topic-modelling\').\n\nUnlike stemming and lemmatization, there is not a standard way to normalize texts. It typically depends on the task. For e.g, the way you would normalize clinical texts would arguably be different from how you normalize text messages.\n\nSome of the common approaches to text normalization include dictionary mappings, statistical machine translation (SMT) and spelling-correction based approaches.# Word CountI am assuming you have the understanding of tokenization,the first figure we can calculate is the word frequency.By word frequency we can find out how many times each tokens appear in the text. When talking about word frequency, we distinguished between types and tokens.Types are the distinct words in a corpus, whereas tokens are the words, including repeats. Let\'s see how this works in practice.\n\nLet\'s take an example for better understanding:\n\n“There is no need to panic. We need to work together, take small yet important measures to ensure self-protection,” the Prime Minister tweeted.\n\nHow many tokens and types are there in above sentences?\n\nLet\'s use Python for calculating these figures. First, tokenize the sentence by using the tokenizer which uses the non-alphabetic characters as a separator.\n\n[/INST]  ```\nimport re\n\ntext = "There is no need to panic. We need to work together, take small yet important measures to ensure self-protection,"\n\ntokens = re.split(r\'\\W+\', text)\n\nprint(len(tokens))\n\ntypes = set(tokens)\n\nprint(len(types))\n```\nThis code will output the number of tokens and the number of types in the text.\n\nThe output will be:\n```\n14\n8\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The first line imports the `re` module, which is used for regular expressions.\n* The second line defines the text to be tokenized.\n* The third line uses the `re.split()` function to split the text into tokens based on non-alphabetic characters.\n* The fourth line calculates the number of tokens by using the `len()` function.\n* The fifth line calculates the number of types by using the `set()` function to create a set of unique tokens.\n* The sixth line prints the number of tokens and the number of types.\n\nNote: The `re.split()` function is used to split'}]

But, it is not able to capture the short-term volatility in the sales as accurately as other methods. Maybe this method can be combined with other low-level forecasters to produce better results.## Exponential smoothing \n\nThe **exponential smoothing** method uses a different type of smoothing which differs from average smoothing. The previous time steps are exponentially weighted and added up to generate the forecast. The weights decay as we move further backwards in time. The model can be summarized as follows:\n\n\n\n\nIn the above equations, $\\alpha$ is the smoothing parameter. The forecast *yt+1* is a weighted average of all the observations in the series *y1, … ,yt*. The rate at which the weights decay is controlled by the parameter *α*. This method gives different weightage to different time steps, instead of giving the same weightage to all time steps (like the moving average method). This ensures that recent sales data is given more importance than old sales data while making the forecast. Now let us see how this new smoothing method performs on our miniature dataset.

Instead, in an embedding, words are represented by dense vectors where a vector represents the projection of the word into a continuous vector space.\n- The position of a word within the vector space is learned from text and is based on the words that surround the word when it is used. The position of a word in the learned vector space is referred to as its embedding. Two popular examples of methods of learning word embeddings from text include:\n    - **Word2Vec.**\n    - **GloVe.**\n**In addition to these carefully designed methods, a word embedding can be learned as part of a deep learning model. This can be a slower approach, but tailors the model to a specific training dataset.**# **Keras Embedding Layer**\n- Keras offers an Embedding layer that can be used for neural networks on text data.

We need more complex models which use several time stamps to make forecasts.## Moving average \n\nThe **moving average** method is more complex than the naive approach. It calculates the mean sales over the previous 30 (or any other number)  days and forecasts that as the next day's sales. This method takes the previous 30 timesteps into consideration, and is therefore less prone to short term fluctuations than the naive approach. The model can be summarized as follows:\n\n\n\nIn the above equation, *yt+1* is tomorrow's sales. On the right hand side, all the sales for the previous 30 days are added up and divided by 30 to find the average. This forms the model's prediction, *yt+1*.

Model Building.\n4. Model Training and Prediction.\n5. Conclusion.\n\nThis exemple was simply taken in the book **Deep Learning with Keras**, *by Antonio Gulli and Sujit Pal, 2017.*\n## 1. Introduction.\n\nRNNs have been used extensively by the **natural language processing (NLP)** community for various applications. One such application is building language models. A language model allows us to predict the probability of a word in a text given the previous words. Language models are important for various higher level tasks such as machine translation, spelling correction, and so on.\n\nA side effect of the ability to predict the next word given previous words is a generative model that allows us to generate text by ***sampling from the output probabilities***. In language modeling, our input is typically a sequence of words and the output is a sequence of predicted words. The training data used is existing unlabeled text, where we set the label **y(t)** at time **t** to be the input **x(t+1)** at time **t+1**.\n\nWe will train a character based language model on the text of ***Alice in Wonderland*** to predict the next character given **10** previous characters. We have chosen to build a character-based model here because it has a smaller vocabulary and trains quicker. The idea is the same as using a **word-based language model**, except we use characters instead of words. We will then use the trained model to generate some text in the same style.\n\nLet's get started.[/INST]  ```\n# Importing necessary libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import SimpleRNN\nfrom keras.utils import to_categorical\nfrom keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\nfrom keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences\n\n# Loading the data\ntrain_data = pd.read_csv('alice_in_wonderland.txt', header=None, encoding='utf-8')\n\n# Preprocessing the data\ntokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=10000)\ntokenizer.fit_on_texts(train_data[0])\nsequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(train_data[0])\n\n# Pad sequences to have the same length\nmax_length = 10\npadded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=max_length)\n\n# Convert to categorical labels\nlabels = to_categorical(train_data[1])\n\n# Split data into training and testing sets\ntrain_x, test"}]

It thus needs a custom solution.\n\n* One has to make an assumption that ethical and social commentary may largely be found in the main body of research articles, and thus a solution needs to support full text search capabilities, not just limited to Title and Abstract searches.\n\n* A solution needs to understand context (due to the generalability of the topic) and thus go beyond "elastic" type keyword searches. For instance, the solution needs to understand that "ethical" and "moral" fall under the same realm, and thus be able to search for content where "ethical/social" are not explicitly mentioned.\n\n* The solution needs to be fast, so that end users can quickly iterate and refine their searches, especially during these pressing times.\n\n# Solution\n*  An Ethics-only model solution is presented. The model can perform searches on three levels: (1)Title Search, (2) Abstract Search and (3)Full Text Search.\n\n* The model is optimized for understanding semanticity, and furthermore trained on a custom-created Annotated Dataset, specific to the sub-tasks of the topic.\n\n* The model gives ability the ability to the user to either limit or expand their search criteria.\n\n* Model is designed to be fast even with full-text searches, so that end-users can quickly iterate.\n    # Methodology\n\n* The input data was preprocessed using a fork of the code initially published https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/cord-19-eda-parse-json-and-generate-clean-csv by XingHanLu. The preprocessing code is available here:https://www.kaggle.com/ayan78/rawdataprocessor \n\n* The core of the model lies in embedding the entire corpus of documents. While there are many options, the most practical one involves using a sentence encoder. The sentence encoder chosen for this task is derived from the great work done by Nils Reimers and his team (https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers). Their models are trained to enhance semantic understanding and hence is a great starting point.\n\n* Initial testing on corpus titles and abstracts revealed good results. The model captured relevant results where titles did not have the words "ethical or social" in them. However, the results lacked breadth, where mostly the same results were coming up, irrespective of the search query.\n\n* To enhance breadth, I endeavored onto the laborious task of generating an Annotated Dataset. I took the 7 main sub-topics of the Ethics Task and started searching for content via web search for each of them. I then assigned a score ranging in [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1] for each search result. Each search result got 7 scores (i.e. how closely did the search result match to each of the 7 sub-topics based). I created a dataset with 1000 records. I also made sure that none of the searches were directly coming from the CORD corpus, in order to avoid any overfitting. Annotated Data can be found here:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/ayan78/stsbenchmark\n\n* The Annotated Dataset was then used to train the original sentence-transformer. The trained model was then used to generate the sentence embeddings for the full corpus. The model training code can be found here:https://www.kaggle.com/ayan78/ethicsdata-transformer\n\n* The sentence embedding process was becoming very lengthy, and hence to expedite the process I used extractive text summarization (bert-extractive-summarizer: https://github.com/dmmiller612/bert-extractive-summarizer). \n\n* Once embedding was done, I used the faiss indexer to index the embeddings. Faiss (https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) is designed for fast searching. I used cosine similarity to rank the searches.\n\n* Search Query results are presented in HTML format. Details below\n# Results\n\n* Results are capped at top 20 results. This can easily be changed by the end-user to either restrict or expand their search.\n* Search Results are provided in HTML format. Snapshot below:\n\n* HTML page has a wordcloud of all the text retrieved from the query.\n* This is followed by a list of titles which are linked to respective urls. If a url for a paper is missing, url links to a google search of the title.\n* The titles are followed by cord_uid and paper_id (sha) where available.\n* The user then has the option of reading the relevant content (related to the search query) within the article, This is via a toggle button shown below:\n\n* Results for each of the 7 sub-tasks can be found here:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/ayan78/ethics-results# Caveats and Next Steps\n\n* The main enhancement of the model came from the training on the Annotated Dataset. However this annotation was done by 1 person (yours truly) who is neither a knowledge expert or from the field. Also 1000 records is merely a drop in the ocean in terms of training size. An enhanced annotated dataset will go a long way in improving the model.\n\n* An empirical threshold is set at 0.6 of cosine similarity to determine whether a search is relevant or not. While this can also be changed by the user to restrict or enhance the results, and is infact done automatically by the model (depending on too many or too few results), a smarter way of thresholding would enhance the solution.\n\n* An extracrive summarizer is used to reduce the corpus, but perhaps an Abstractive Summarizer may work better. This needs to be determined.\n* The training is done in chunks to keep under the 9-hour kaggle limit. Some mechanism for auto-chunking would be nice.

The function uses the `np.sqrt()` function from the NumPy library to calculate the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between the elements of the two vectors.\n\nFor example, if `x = [1, 2, 3]` and `y = [4, 5, 6]`, the function would return `np.sqrt((1 - 4) ** 2 + (2 - 5) ** 2 + (3 - 6) ** 2) = np.sqrt(16 + 25 + 36) = np.sqrt(77)`.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input vectors are numpy arrays. If the input vectors are lists, you may need to convert them to numpy arrays before passing them to this function.'}]

We\'ll have to investigate this further. \n3. There are a LOT of features! Almost 5000! And they outnumber the number of rows in the training set!\n4. There are less than 5000 training rows. In fact, there are fewer rows than columns, which means we\'ll have to invest a lot of effort into feature selection / feature engineering. \n5. The memory size of the train dataset is fairly large - 170 MB, which is to be expected. \n6. Pandas is treating 1845 features as float, and 3147 as integer. It is possible that some of those int features are one-hot-encoded or label-encoded categorical variables. We\'ll have to investigate this later, and possibly do some reverse-engineering. :)\n7. There doesn\'t appear to be any missing values in the train set. This is, IMHO, overall a good thing, although a lot of times there is some signal in the missing values that\'s valuable and worth exploring. \n\nThis is going to be a very, very, interesting competition. :)\n\nNow let\'s take a look at the test dataset.[/INST]  ```\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the test dataset\ntest = pd.read_csv("test.csv")\n\n# Check the number of rows and columns in the test dataset\nprint(f"Number of rows in test dataset: {test.shape[0]}")\nprint(f"Number of columns in test dataset: {test.shape[1]}")\n\n# Check the data types of the columns in the test dataset\nprint(test.dtypes)\n\n# Check for any missing values in the test dataset\nprint(test.isnull().sum())\n\n# Check the memory size of the test dataset\nprint(test.memory_usage(deep=True).sum())\n```\nThis code will load the test dataset, check the number of rows and columns, check the data types of the columns, check for any missing values, and check the memory size of the test dataset.'}]

The `crop()` method returns a new image object that represents the cropped image. The `save()` method saves the cropped image to a new file.\n\nYou can also use the `Image.crop()` method to crop an image from a specific point. For example:\n```\n# Crop the image from the center\ncropped_image = image.crop((image.width / 2,'}]

This is probably, once again, due to the limitations of the camera system. The camera can detect objects that are far ahead, but not too far to the side. And, it can also detect objects that are far to side, but not too far ahead. But, **the camera cannot detect objects that are both far ahead and far to the side**. Because of this, objects that are far ahead and far to the side are not detected at all, and only objects which satisfy one (or none) of those conditions are detected. This results in a negative relationship between *center_x* and *center_y*.### center_z**center_z** corresponds to the *xz* coordinate of the center of an object's location (bounding volume). This coordinate represents the height of the object above the *x-y* plane.### Distribution of *center_z*[/INST]  ```\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Create a histogram of the distribution of center_z\nplt.hist(center_z, bins=50)\nplt.xlabel('center_z')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.title('Distribution of center_z')\nplt.show()\n```\nThis code will create a histogram of the distribution of the *center_z* variable, which corresponds to the height of the object above the *x-y* plane. The `bins` parameter is set to 50, which means that the histogram will have 50 bins. The `plt.xlabel()` and `plt.ylabel()` functions are used to add labels to the x-axis and y-axis of the histogram, respectively. The `plt.title()` function is used to add a title to the histogram. Finally, the `plt.show()` function is used to display the histogram."}]

While considered the most dangerous type of skin cancer because of its ability to rapidly spread throughout the body, melanoma is generally very treatable if found early.2\nhttps://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-melanoma-514215\n\nThe[ Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM)](https://siim.org/page/about_siim) is the leading healthcare professional organization for those interested in the current and future use of informatics in medical imaging. The society's mission is to advance medical imaging informatics across the enterprise through education, research, and innovation in a multi-disciplinary community. The [International Skin Imaging Collaboration or \nISIC](https://siim.org/page/about_siim) Melanoma Project is an academia and industry partnership designed to facilitate the application of digital skin imaging to help reduce melanoma mortality\n\nThe overarching goal of the ISIC Melanoma Project is to support efforts to reduce melanoma-related deaths and unnecessary biopsies by improving the accuracy and efficiency of melanoma early detection since when recognized and treated in its earliest stages, melanoma is readily curable\n\n## Objective\n\nThe objective of this competition is to identify melanoma in images of skin lesions. In particular, we need to use images within the same patient and determine which are likely to represent a melanoma. In other words, we need to create a model which should predict the probability whether the lesion in the image is malignantor benign.Value 0 denotes benign, and 1 indicates malignant\n\n## Dataset\nThe dataset consists of images in :\n* DIOCOM format\n* JPEG format in JPEG directory\n* TFRecord format in tfrecords directory\n\nAdditionally, there is a metadata comprising of train, test and submission file in CSV format.\n\n## Understanding the Evaluation Metric\n\nFor this particluar problem, our submissions will be evaluated using **area under the ROC curve**. An ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) is a graph showing the performance of a classification model at all classification thresholds. This curve plots two parameters:\n\n\n\nAn ROC curve plots TPR vs. FPR at different classification thresholds. Lowering the classification threshold classifies more items as positive, thus increasing both False Positives and True Positives.
