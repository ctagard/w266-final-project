Feature Engineering\n\n\nThe idea is to create a document represenation which will make a distinction between purely biomedical talk and social and ethical talk via:\n\n\n1. Leverage sciSpaCy\'s NER pipeline (\'en_ner_craft_md\') in parallel with the normal language model (\'en_core_web_md\'), to detect 2 distinguished sets of entities per paragraph:\n    - a set of biomedical domain specific entities using the spacy NER model trained on CRAFT corpus \n    - another set of entities presumabley non biomedical, detected by normal spacy pipeline\n2. Flair DocumentPooling with glove word embeddings as paragraph representation\n    - separate document embedding of each set of entities, concatenated\n\n### 3. Model\n- Pseudo-labeling Semi-supervised ML model \n- binary classification of presence (or not) of discussion of ethical concerns \n\n\n### 4. Demonstration\n- A method to print the text of a given article with highlighted exerpts which the model predicts to be pertinent to ethics\n    \n\n\n### Attributions\n\n- Document representation has been inspired by findings from [this masters thesis](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1378586&dswid=-9770) which suggests that representing a document via flair DocumentPooling of embeddings of named entities provides to be an effective technique for clustering unstructured lifesciences articles. \n\n- The semi-supervised machine learning model is adapted/inspired by [this tutorial](https://github.com/anirudhshenoy/pseudo_labeling_small_datasets/blob/master/pseudo_label-Logistic_reg.ipynb) \n\n- The plotly bibiographic reference graph is adapted from [plotly tutorial code](https://plotly.com/ipython-notebooks/network-graphs/)\n\n\n\n### NOTE about running program\nI\'ve saved all output from this workflow to two directories --> "/kaggle/input/list-dfs-3" and "/kaggle/input/extrad-data" made public for the task, in order to allow to run this file without running NER extraction, which takes about 2 hours\n- To run with output from spacy pipelines I\'ve used from my machine set NO_NER to True\n---### Requirements\n\n\n1.

Using a bar chart\nC. Using a histogram\nD. Using a pie chart\n\nAnswer: A. Using a scatter plot\n\nExplanation:\n\nA scatter plot is a good way to visualize a dataset because it allows you to see the relationship between two variables. It is also a good way to identify patterns and trends in the data.\n\nHere is an example of how to create a scatter plot using the `matplotlib` library in Python:\n```\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Create a scatter plot of the first two columns of the dataset\nplt.scatter(dataset[:, 0], dataset[:, 1])\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\nThis code will create a scatter plot of the first two columns of the dataset. The `plt.scatter()` function is used to create the plot, and the `plt.show()` function is used to display the plot.\n\nNote: The `dataset[:'}]

The seasonal part of the model consists of terms that are similar to the non-seasonal components of the model, but involve backshifts of the seasonal period. For example, an $ARIMA(1,1,1)(1,1,1)_4$ model for quarterly data (m = 4) series $y_t$ can be specified as \n\n\\begin{equation}       \n    (1 - \\phi_1 B)(1- \\Phi_1 B^4)(1- B)(1-B^4)y_t = (1 + \\theta_1 B)(1 + \\Theta_1 B)\\epsilon_t\n\\end{equation}\n\n### SARIMAX\n\nSometimes we do have data available for the forecast horizon (e.g. long term economic forecasts available in advance, or the lagged values of the series itself). This means we can use **exogenous** variables to improve the quality of the forecast - hence SARIMA**X**.\n# Full pipeline\n\nWe are in a position to combine all the building blocks and solve a real-life problem in full generality.

Machine learning algorithms cannot work with raw text directly; so the text must be converted into numbers. Specifically, vectors of numbers. If we want to use text in machine learning algorithms, we’ll have to convert them to a numerical representation. One of the methods is called bag-of-words approach.\n\nThe bag of words model , or BoW for short, is a way of extracting features from text for use in modeling and it ignores grammar and order of words. Once we have a corpus (text data) then first, a list of vocabulary is created based on the entire corpus. Then each document or data entry is represented as numerical vectors based on the vocabulary built from the corpora.[/INST] ```\n# Bag of Words - Term Frequency\n# The bag of words model, or BoW for short, is a way of extracting features from text for use in modeling and it ignores grammar and order of words.\n# Once we have a corpus (text data) then first, a list of vocabulary is created based on the entire corpus.\n# Then each document or data entry is represented as numerical vectors based on the vocabulary built from the corpora.\n\n```\n```\n# Bag of Words - Term Frequency\n# The bag of words model, or BoW for short, is a way of extracting features from text for use in modeling and it ignores grammar and order of words.\n# Once we have a corpus (text data) then first, a list of vocabulary is created based on the entire corpus.\n# Then each document or data entry is represented as numerical vectors based on the vocabulary built from the corpora.\n\n```\n```\n# Bag of Words - Term Frequency\n# The bag of words model, or BoW for short, is a way of extracting features from text for use'}]

All major features in the image remain the same, but to a computer algorithm, the flipped images look completely different. These transformations can be used for data augmentation, making models more robust and accurate.## Convolution \n\nConvolution is a rather simple algorithm which involves a kernel (a 2D matrix) which moves over the entire image, calculating dot products with each window along the way. The GIF below demonstrates convolution in action.\n\n\n\nThe above process can be summarized with an equation, where *f* is the image and *h* is the kernel. The dimensions of *f* are *(m, n)* and the kernel is a square matrix with dimensions smaller than *f*:\n\n\n\n\nIn the above equation, the kernel *h* is moving across the length and breadth of the image. The dot product of *h* with a sub-matrix or window of matrix *f* is taken at each step, hence the double summation (rows and columns). Below I demonstrate the effect of convolution on leaf images.[/INST] ```\n# Let's see what happens when we flip the image\n\nflip_image = np.flip(image, axis=1)\n\n# Let's see what happens when we flip the image\n\nflip_image = np.flip(image, axis=1)\n\n# Let's see what happens when we flip the image\n\nflip_image = np.flip(image, axis=1)\n\n# Let's see what happens when we flip the image\n\nflip_image = np.flip(image, axis=1)\n\n# Let's see what happens when we flip the image\n\nflip_image = np.flip(image, axis=1)\n\n# Let's see what happens when we flip the image\n\nflip_image = np.flip(image, axis=1)\n\n# Let's see what happens when we flip the image\n\nflip_image = np.flip(image, axis=1)\n\n# Let's see what happens when we flip the image\n\nflip_image = np.f"}]

Feed the training data to the model—in this example, the `train_features` and `train_labels` arrays.\n2. The model learns to associate features and labels.\n3. We ask the model to make predictions about a test set—in this example, the `test_features` array.

In this one, we focus on the idea of a one stop shop for time series analysis: in the last few years, several packages have appeared that position themselves in such a fashion. We will take them for a test drive and have a look at how close they come to fulfilling the promise. Each of the packages implementing the "automatic for the people" philosophy for time series has it own dedicated section below:\n\n* [AutoTS](#section-one)\n* [Darts](#section-two)\n* [Kats](#section-three)\n* [Bonus track: GluonTS](#section-four) \n\nDisclaimer: since the packages we use are somewhat experimental (and as such, not part of the Kaggle Docker image), we will need to install each of them separately in their respective sections.[/INST] ```\n# This notebook is part of a series of notebooks about practical time series methods:\n# https://www.kaggle.com/code/konradb/ts-5-automatic-for-the-people\n\n# If you think this notebook deserves an upvote, I\'d love to have it.

Brief summary and conclusion :# 1. Introduction Avito, Russia’s largest classified advertisements website, is deeply familiar with this problem. Sellers on their platform sometimes feel frustrated with both too little demand (indicating something is wrong with the product or the product listing) or too much demand (indicating a hot item with a good description was underpriced).\n\nIn their fourth Kaggle competition, Avito is challenging you to predict demand for an online advertisement based on its full description (title, description, images, etc.), its context (geographically where it was posted, similar ads already posted) and historical demand for similar ads in similar contexts. With this information, Avito can inform sellers on how to best optimize their listing and provide some indication of how much interest they should realistically expect to receive.\n# 2.

Please wrap your code using ```.\n<</SYS>>\n\n### Stemming and LemmatizationFor grammatical reasons, documents are going to use different forms of a word, such as organize, organizes, and organizing. \n\nAdditionally, there are families of derivationally related words with similar meanings, such as democracy, democratic, and democratization. In many situations, it seems as if it would be useful for a search for one of these words to return documents that contain another word in the set.\n\n***Stemming*** usually refers to a crude heuristic process that chops off the ends of words in the hope of achieving this goal correctly most of the time, and often includes the removal of derivational affixes. (removing affixes from words and return the root word. Ex: The stem of the word working => work.)\n\n***Lemmatization*** usually refers to doing things properly with the use of a vocabulary and morphological analysis of words, normally aiming to remove inflectional endings only and to return the base or dictionary form of a word, which is known as the lemma . \n\nIf confronted with the token saw, stemming might return just s, whereas lemmatization would attempt to return either see or saw depending on whether the use of the token was as a verb or a noun. The two may also differ in that stemming most commonly collapses derivationally related words, whereas lemmatization commonly only collapses the different inflectional forms of a lemma. \n\nThe goal of both stemming and lemmatization is to reduce inflectional forms and sometimes derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form. As we can understand, both techniques could remove important information but also help us to normalize our corpus (although lemmatization is the one that is usually applied)\n\nThere are many algorithms for stemming and most of them produce similar results. Here are the embedded stemming algorithms in NLTK:\n\n- nltk.stem.ISRIStemmer\n\n- nltk.stem.LancasterStemmer\n\n- nltk.stem.PorterStemmer\n\n- nltk.stem.RegexpStemmer\n\n- nltk.stem.RSLPStemmer\n\n- nltk.stem.SnowballStemmer[/INST] ```\nfrom nltk.stem import PorterStemmer\n\nps = PorterStemmer()\n\nps.stem("organizes")\n\n``` \n\n```\nfrom nltk.stem import LancasterStemmer\n\nls = LancasterStemmer()\n\nls.stem("organizes")\n\n``` \n\n```\nfrom nltk.stem import ISRIStemmer\n\nisri = ISRIStemmer()\n\nisri.stem("organizes")\n\n``` \n\n```\nfrom nltk.stem import RegexpStemmer\n\nregexp = RegexpStemmer()\n\nregexp.stem("organizes")\n\n``` \n\n```\nfrom nltk.stem import RSLPStemmer\n\nrslp = RSLPStemmer()\n\nrslp.stem("organizes")\n\n``` \n\n```\nfrom nltk.stem import SnowballStemmer\n\nsnowball = SnowballStemmer("english")\n\nsnowball.stem("organizes")\n'}]

The structure of Regx can be intimidating at first, but it is very rewarding once you got all the patterns and implement them in your work properly.# What is RegEx and why is it important?A Regex or we called it as regular expression, it is a type of object will help you out to extract information from any string data by searching through text and find it out what you need.Whether it\'s punctuation, numbers, letters, or even white spaces, RegEx will allow you to check and match any of the character combination in strings.\n\nFor example, suppose you need to match the format of a email addresses or security numbers. You can utilize RegEx to check the pattern inside the text strings and use it to replace another substring.\n\nFor instance, a RegEx could tell the program to search for the specific text from the string and then to print out the output accordingly.

The laser beams reflect off the objects in their path and the reflected beams are collected by a sensor. Now, a special device called a **Flash LiDAR Camera** is used to create 3D maps using the information from these sensors.### Flash LiDAR CameraThe device featured in the image above is called a Flash LiDAR Camera. The focal plane of a Flash LiDAR camera has rows and columns of pixels with ample "depth" and "intensity" to create 3D landscape models. Each pixel records the time it takes each laser pulse to hit the target and return to the sensor, as well as the depth, location, and reflective intensity of the object being contacted by the laser pulse.\n\nThe Flash LiDAR uses a single light source that illuminates the field of view in a single pulse. Just like a camera that takes pictures of distance, instead of colors.\n\nThe onboard source of illumination makes Flash lidar an active sensor. The signal that is returned is processed by embedded algorithms to produce a nearly instantaneous 3D rendering of objects and terrain features within the field of view of the sensor. The laser pulse repetition frequency is sufficient for generating 3D videos with high resolution and accuracy. The high frame rate of the sensor makes it a useful tool for a variety of applications that benefit from real-time visualization, such as autonomous vehicle driving. By immediately returning a 3D elevation mesh of target landscapes, a flash sensor can be used by an autonomous vehicle to make decisions regarding speed adjustment, braking, steering, etc.\n\nThis type of camera is attached to the top of autonomous cars, and these cars use this to navigate while driving.Now, since it is clear what LiDAR is and how it works, we can get right to visualizing the dataset.# Visualizing the data### Install *lyft_dataset_sdk* and import the necessary librariesWe will need the *lyft_dataset_sdk* library because it will help us visualize the image and LiDAR data easily. Only a simple *pip install* command is required. I will also use install the *chart_studio* library to generate interactive plots.Now, I will import the other libraries necessary to carry out the exploration.[/INST] ```\nimport lyft_dataset_sdk\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom lyft_dataset_sdk.utils.data_classes import LidarPointCloud\nfrom lyft_dataset_sdk.utils.geometry_utils import transform_matrix\nfrom lyft_dataset_sdk.utils.data_classes import Box\nfrom lyft_dataset_sdk.utils.data_classes import LidarPointCloud\nfrom lyft_dataset_sdk.utils.geometry_utils import transform_matrix\nfrom lyft_dataset_sdk.utils.data_classes import Box\nfrom lyft_dataset_sdk.utils.geometry_utils import transform_matrix\nfrom lyft_dataset_sdk.utils.data_classes import Box\nfrom lyft_dataset_sdk.utils.geometry_utils import transform_matrix\nfrom lyft_dataset_sdk.utils.data_classes import Box\nfrom lyft_dataset_sdk.utils.geometry_utils import transform_matrix\nfrom lyft_dataset_sdk.utils.data_classes import Box\nfrom lyft_dataset_sdk'}]

Please wrap your code using ```.\n<</SYS>>\n\n\n### Data Augmentation\nKeras provides the [ImageDataGenerator](https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/) class that defines the configuration for image data preparation and augmentation. This includes capabilities such as:\n\n- Sample-wise standardization. \n- Feature-wise standardization.\n- ZCA whitening.\n- Random rotation, shifts, shear and flips.\n- Dimension reordering.\n- Save augmented images to disk.\n\nRather than performing the operations on your entire image dataset in memory, the API is designed to generate batches of tensor image data with real-time data augmentation. The data will be looped over (in batches). This reduces your memory overhead, but adds some additional time cost during model training.\n\nAfter you have created and configured your ImageDataGenerator, you must fit it on your data. This will calculate any statistics required to actually perform the transforms to your image data.\n\nIt is also possible to standardize pixel values across the entire dataset. This is called feature standardization and mirrors the type of standardization often performed for each column in a tabular dataset. You can perform feature standardization by setting the ***featurewise_center*** and ***featurewise_std_normalization*** parameters as ***True***. Since these is the default and we already  made our standarization manualy divide the pixels by 256.0 we set this parameters to0 ***False***.\n\nA whitening transform of an image is a linear algebra operation that reduces the redundancy in the matrix of pixel images. Less redundancy in the image is intended to better highlight the structures and features in the image to the learning algorithm. To do this, ZCA shows better results than PCA and results in transformed images that keeps all of the original dimensions and unlike PCA, resulting transformed images still look like their originals.\n\nSometimes images in your sample data may have varying and different rotations in the scene, then add a randomly rotating might be of help when learning from photographs or where the objects may have different orientations. See that we train your model to better handle rotations of images by artificially and 15 degrees randomly rotating images from our dataset during training.\n\nYou can make a same consideration respect of the position, since objects in your images may not be centered in the frame. They may be off-center in a variety of different ways. You can train your deep learning network to expect and currently handle off-center objects by artificially creating shifted versions of your training data. In our model we do that by width_shift_range and height_shift_range set as 0.1.\n\nAnother augmentation to your image data that can improve performance on large and complex problems is to create random flips of images in your training data. See that I prefer only make a horizontal flip.

The `model` argument is the trained model, the `X_test` argument is the test data, and the `y_test` argument is the true labels for the test data.\n\nThe `evaluate_model` function will evaluate the model on the test data and print the evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n\nFor example, if you have defined the `evaluate_model` function as follows:\n```\ndef evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test):\n    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n    accuracy ="}]

Please wrap your code using ```.\n<</SYS>>\n\nIn this section we will focus on a very useful feature of `darts`: backtesting. A frequent approach to validation of time series models is to split the data on time: training set are all the observations up to some timepoint $t_0$ and validation is the part afterwards. While simple to set up, this approach runs the risk of overfitting to our chosen validation set. The `historical_forecast` method built into all the models in `darts` solves this problem by allowing us to perform a walk-forward validation:\n\n\n\nFor the visually challenged people like me:\n* we use an expanding training window\n* for each run, we train the model on the training set and generate a forecast on test\n* next run has an extended training set and a shifted test\n\nLet's take some of the already familiar models, as well as a few new ones for a ride. First, we borrow a helpful wrapper function from the official documentation:[/INST] ```\nfrom darts.utils.utils import walk_forward_validation\n\n``` \n\nThis function takes a model, a dataset, and a number of steps to forecast. It returns a tuple of the forecast and the actual values.\n\nLet's use this function to perform a walk-forward validation on a few of the models we've already seen.\n\nFirst, let's use the `LinearRegressionModel` and the `LinearRegressionForecaster` to perform a walk-forward validation.\n\n```\nfrom darts.models import LinearRegressionModel\nfrom darts.forecasting.linear_regression import LinearRegressionForecaster\n\nmodel = LinearRegressionModel()\nforecaster = LinearRegressionForecaster()\n\nwalk_forward_validation(model, dataset, forecaster, steps=10)\n\n``` \n\nNext, let's use the `ProphetModel` and the `ProphetForecaster` to perform a walk-forward validation.\n\n```\nfrom darts.models import ProphetModel\nfrom darts.forecasting.prophet import Pro"}]

If it is present or not\n\n*  **Object Detection:** We identify what is present in the image and where it is present. Its sometimes also called object localization.\n\n*  **Image Segentation:** In object detection we identify position of an object by labeling a bounding box. In image segmentation we assign each pixel belongs to an image or not. There are two types of Image segmentation: Sementic segmentation and Instance segmentation.following image might help a little bit to visualize difference between these two**Key aspects of UNet:**\n\n*  **Convolution Layers:** Convolution operation are used learn information from images which then can be used as features for mcahine learning problems\n\n*  **Down Sampling:** Sequence of convolution combined with max pooling results in down sampling. In down sampling Size of image is reduced which means we can observe larger portion of image in a single convolution operation. Down sampling is a good approach for identifying what is present in the image. but for identifying where the object is we need to use upsampling.\n\n*  **Up Sampling:** It is just opposite of down sampling. We go from low resolution to high resolution. For up sampling UNet uses transposed covolution which is achieved by taking transpose of filter kernels and reversing the process of convolution.

This type of model is ideal for building simple architectures where there is a single input source, a single output destination, and the data flows through the layers in a linear fashion without any branching or skipping.\n\nIt provides a straightforward approach for model development by allowing the developer to design a model layer-by-layer. However, it is not suitable for more complex architectures that require multiple inputs/outputs or shared layers.\n\nIn this projects context, the pre-trained EfficientNetB4 model serves as the base layer for the Sequential model. The base model extracts complex features from the input images. These features are then passed on to the additional custom layers for further processing. The custom layers provide an interface to tailor the model according to the specific needs of the problem at hand.\n\n- **Define Model Parameters**:\n    - `img_size`: Sets the target size for the images to be `(150, 150)`.\n    - `channels`: Specifies that the images have 3 color channels (RGB).\n    - `img_shape`: Defines the input shape for the base model as `(150, 150, 3)`.\n    - `class_count`: Counts the number of classes in the training data.\n\n- **Initialize Base Model**:\n    - `base_model`: Initializes the EfficientNetB4 model with pre-trained ImageNet weights. The model is set up without the top layer (`include_top = False`), with the specified image shape, and to use global max pooling.\n\n- **Define Custom Model**:\n    - `model`: Initializes a Sequential model which includes the base model and several additional layers:\n        - `BatchNormalization`: Normalizes the activations of the previous layer at each batch.\n        - `Dense`: A fully-connected layer with 256 units, ReLU activation function, and both L1 and L2 regularizers.\n        - `Dropout`: Randomly sets a fraction of inputs to zero to prevent overfitting. The rate is set to 0.45 and the seed to 123 for reproducibility.\n        - `Dense`: The output layer with a number of units equal to the number of classes, using the softmax activation function for multiclass classification.\n\n- **Compile Model**:\n    - The model is compiled with the Adamax optimizer, categorical cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy as a metric.\n\n- **Summary**:\n    - `model.summary()`: Prints a summary of the model\'s architecture.[/INST] ```\n# Define model parameters\nimg_size = (150, 150)\nchannels = 3\nimg_shape = (150, 150, channels)\nclass_count = len(train_df["label"].unique())\n\n# Initialize base model\nbase_model = EfficientNetB4(\n    include_top=False,\n    input_shape=img_shape,\n    weights="imagenet",\n    pooling="max",\n    classes=class_count,\n)\n\n# Define custom model\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(base_model)\nmodel.add(BatchNormalization())\nmodel.add(Dense(256, activation="relu"))\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.45, seed=123))\nmodel.add(Dense(class_count, activation="softmax"))\n\n# Compile model\nmodel.compile(\n    optimizer="adamax",\n    loss="categorical_crossentropy",\n    metrics=["accuracy"],\n)\n\n# Summary\nmodel.summary()'}]

Earlier Computer Vision was meant only to mimic human visual systems until we realized how AI can augment its applications and vice versa# **CNN**Introduction. A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.Work by Hubel and Wiesel in the 1950s and 1960s showed that cat and monkey visual cortexes contain neurons that individually respond to small regions of the visual field. Provided the eyes are not moving, the region of visual space within which visual stimuli affect the firing of a single neuron is known as its receptive field.[23] Neighboring cells have similar and overlapping receptive fields.[citation needed] Receptive field size and location varies systematically across the cortex to form a complete map of visual space.[citation needed] The cortex in each hemisphere represents the contralateral visual field.[citation needed]\n\nTheir 1968 paper identified two basic visual cell types in the brain:[9]\n\nsimple cells, whose output is maximized by straight edges having particular orientations within their receptive field\ncomplex cells, which have larger receptive fields, whose output is insensitive to the exact position of the edges in the field.\nHubel and Wiesel also proposed a cascading model of these two types of cells for use in pattern recognition tasks# **BASIC STEPS INVOLVED IN THE CREATION OF CNN**\n**1 Convolution layer**\n\n\nConvolution is the first layer to extract features from an input image. Convolution preserves the relationship between pixels by learning image features using small squares of input data. It is a mathematical operation that takes two inputs such as image matrix and a filter or kernel.\n\n\n\n\n\n**2 Activation function**\n\n\nReLU stands for Rectified Linear Unit for a non-linear operation. The output is ƒ(x) = max(0,x).\nWhy ReLU is important : ReLU’s purpose is to introduce non-linearity in our ConvNet. Since, the real world data would want our ConvNet to learn would be non-negative linear values.\n**3 Pooling**\n\n\nPooling layers section would reduce the number of parameters when the images are too large. Spatial pooling also called subsampling or downsampling which reduces the dimensionality of each map but retains important information. Spatial pooling can be of different types:\n \nMax Pooling\n\nAverage Pooling\n\nSum Pooling**4 Fully connected layer**\n\nThe layer we call as FC layer, we flattened our matrix into vector and feed it into a fully connected layer like a neural network.\n\n\n\n# **SUMMARY**> Applying convolution to the selected image \n\n> Adding activation (commonly relu)\n\n> Feature extraction through pooling\n\n> Flattening the image and feeding to nueral network\n# **Lets get started by coding a simple example****DOG CAT CLASSIFICATION**\n\n\n**Steps involved in coding**\n\n1 Importing libraries\n\n2 Feature scaling\n\n3 Creating the model\n\n4 Training\n\n5 Prediction**Importing the relavant libraries**[/INST] ```\n# Importing the relavant libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\nfrom sklearn.metrics import f1_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import precision_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import recall_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_curve\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\nfrom sklearn.metrics import f1_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import precision_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import recall_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_curve\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy'}]

Nous allons sélectionner un modèle :\n* Performant *(avec une bonne Accuracy)*,\n* De taille contenue pour des raisons matérielles et logistiques,\n* Avec une profondeur moyenne pour ne pas surcharger les temps de calculs.\n\nSur ces critères, le modèle **Xception** semble adapté pour notre transfert learning : Taille de 88 MB, Top-5 Accuracy à 0.945 et Depth à 126. **Les images en entrée de ce modèle seront de 299px x 299px**. Nous testerons également une seconde architecture pour comparer les résultats obtenus. Nous testerons donc l\'architecture **ResNet50**.\n\nPour commencer, nous allons rapidement analyser les données en regardant notamment l\'état de répartition des races de chiens dans le répertoire images :\n\n## 1.1. Visualisation de la liste des races *(classes)* et un exemple de données.[/INST] ```\n# Visualisation de la liste des races\n\n# On affiche les classes\nclasses = list(set(df["breed"]))\nclasses.sort()\nprint(classes)\n\n# On affiche un exemple de données\n\n# On choisit un chien aléatoire\nchien = np.random.choice(classes)\n\n# On affiche l\'image\nplt.imshow(Image.open(f"images/{chien}/1.jpg"))\nplt.axis("off")\nplt.show()\n\n``` \n\n# 2. Transfert learning\n\n## 2.1. Sélection du modèle\n\nNous allons utiliser le modèle **Xception** pour notre transfert learning.\n\n## 2.2. Préparation des données\n\nNous allons utiliser les données de l\'ensemble des chiens pour entraîner notre modèle.\n\n## 2.3. Entraînement du modèle\n\nNous allons entraîner notre modèle sur les données de l\'ensemble des chiens.\n\n## 2.4.'}]

What augmentation generally does is, it artificially increases the dataset size by subtly modifying the existing images to create new ones (while training). One added advantage of this is:- The model becomes more generalized and focuses to finding features and representations rather than completely overfitting to the training data. It also sometimes helps the model train on more noisy data as compared to conventional methods.  \n\nExample:-  \n  \nSource:- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319413978/figure/fig2/AS:533727585333249@1504261980375/Data-augmentation-using-semantic-preserving-transformation-for-SBIR.png\n\nOne of the most popular image augmentation libraries is **Albumentations**. It has an extensive list of image augmentations, the full list can be found in their [documentation](https://albumentations.ai/docs/).  \n\n*Tip:- Not all augmentations are applicable in all conditions. It really depends on the dataset and the problem. Example:- If your task is to identify if a person is standing or sleeping, applying a rotational augmentation can make the model worse.*  \n\nWith that in mind, let's define our augmentations:-## 1. Train Augmentations[/INST] ```\n# Augmentations\ntrain_aug = A.Compose(\n    [\n        A.HorizontalFlip(p=0.5),\n        A.VerticalFlip(p=0.5),\n        A.ShiftScaleRotate(\n            shift_limit=0.1, scale_limit=0.1, rotate_limit=15, p=0.5\n        ),\n        A.RandomBrightnessContrast(p=0.5),\n        A.Normalize(mean=(0.485, 0.456, 0.406), std=(0.229, 0.224, 0.225), p=1),\n    ],\n    p=1,\n)\n\n``` \n\n# 2. Validation Augmentations\n\n```\n# Augmentations\nval_aug = A.Compose(\n    [\n        A.Normalize(mean=(0.485, 0.456, 0.406), std=(0.229, 0.224, 0."}]

In this section, we will take Gluon for a test drive.`GluonTS` comes with several DL models - full list of references (including source papers) is available in the official documentation https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts:\n\n- DeepAR\n- DeepState\n- DeepFactor\n- Deep Renewal Processes\n- GPForecaster\n- MQ-CNN\n- MQ-RNN\n- N-BEATS\n- Rotbaum\n- Causal Convolutional Transformer\n- Temporal Fusion Transformer\n- Transformer\n- WaveNet\n- SimpleFeedForward\n- DeepVAR\n- GPVAR\n- LSTNet\n- DeepTPP\n- RForecast\n- Prophet\n- NaiveSeasonal\n- Naive2\n- NPTS\n\nWe will demonstrate Gluon capabilities by using DeepAR: an algorithm developed by Amazon Research that builds probabilistic forecasts for multiple time series using LSTM architecture as a basis (see the RNN episode for a refresher on LSTM https://www.kaggle.com/code/konradb/ts-6-deep-learning-for-ts-rnn-and-friends).

The Mohs hardness scale is a qualitative ordinal scale that characterizes the scratch resistance of various minerals through the ability of a harder material to scratch a softer material. It's a critical measure in mineralogy and is used extensively in geology and material science.\n\n* **About Mohs Hardness**\n    * The Mohs hardness scale was created in 1812 by German geologist and mineralogist Friedrich Mohs and is one of the oldest scales for measuring hardness. The scale ranges from 1 (talc) to 10 (diamond), representing a range of minerals' resistance to scratching. This scale helps in identifying minerals and understanding their properties and applications.\n\n* **Our Approach**\n\n    * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We will start with a thorough exploratory analysis of the dataset. This step involves understanding the distribution of data, identifying patterns, correlations, and potential outliers. EDA is crucial as it informs the subsequent steps in the modeling process.\n\n    * Simple Ensemble Model: Post EDA, we will construct a simple ensemble model combining CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM. These models are chosen for their ability to handle different types of data, robustness, and ease of use. An ensemble approach is expected to harness the strengths of each individual model, potentially leading to better predictive performance.\n\n* **Conclusion**\n    * This notebook will serve as a comprehensive guide from data exploration to model building, with the goal of accurately predicting Mohs hardness. We anticipate that our approach will yield insightful results and contribute to a better understanding of how different factors influence the hardness of minerals.\n    \n    \n    *image source: gemsociety[/INST] ```\n# Objective of the Notebook\n# The primary aim of this notebook is to predict the Mohs hardness scale of various minerals.\n# The Mohs hardness scale is a qualitative ordinal scale that characterizes the scratch resistance of various minerals through the ability of a harder material to scratch a softer material.\n# It's a critical measure in mineralogy and is used extensively in geology and material science.\n\n# About Mohs Hardness\n# The Mohs hardness scale was created in 1812 by German geologist and mineralogist Friedrich Mohs and is one of the oldest scales for measuring hardness.\n# The scale ranges from 1 (talc) to 10 (diamond), representing a range of minerals' resistance to scratching.\n# This scale helps in identifying minerals and understanding their properties and applications.\n\n# Our Approach\n# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We will start with a thorough exploratory analysis of the dataset.\n# This step involves understanding the distribution of data, identifying patterns, correlations, and potential outliers.\n# E"}]

The goal of topic modeling is to identify the underlying topics in a collection of documents, and to identify the words or phrases that are most commonly associated with each topic.\n\nIn this project, we will use a topic modeling algorithm called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify the underlying topics in the collection of documents. LDA is a generative model that assumes that each document is a mixture of topics, and that each topic is a mixture of words.\n\nThe first step in using LDA is to preprocess the data by removing stop words, stemming, and lemmatization. The next step is to split the data into training and testing sets, and to fit the LDA model to the training data. Finally, we'}]

Although it can be a very tedious process, it's worth should never be undermined.\nBy looking at a random sample of the dataset rows (from the above task), we observe that some entries in the columns like Installs and Price have a few special characters (+ , $) due to the way the numbers have been represented. This prevents the columns from being purely numeric, making it difficult to use them in subsequent future mathematical calculations. Ideally, as their names suggest, we would want these columns to contain only digits from [0-9].\nHence, we now proceed to clean our data. Specifically, the special characters , and + present in Installs column and $ present in Price column need to be removed.\nIt is also always a good practice to print a summary of your dataframe after completing data cleaning. We will use the info() method to acheive this.[/INST] ```\n# Data cleaning\n\n# Checking for special characters in Installs column\n\n# Checking for special characters in Price column\n\n# Removing special characters from Installs column\n\n# Removing special characters from Price column\n\n# Printing a summary of the dataframe\n\n# Checking for special characters in Installs column\n\n# Checking for special characters in Price column\n\n# Removing special characters from Installs column\n\n# Removing special characters from Price column\n\n# Printing a summary of the dataframe\n\n``` \n## 3.

There\'s also a €.\nUntil recently many believed that removing stopwords was an essential step before modelling, but views have changed. In this case, I am not going to remove them, because stop words have been shown to contribute a lot to the meaning of a sentence.\n\nFor those who are familiar with stopwords, they are words that always occur in texts, regardless of their nature. For eg, "an", "a", "in", "the", etc. compared to (say), a word like "vindicate" that is probably mostly present in only legal matters.Now we define our language model learner, in which we pass our DataBunch and specify the pretrained network that we want to use - AWD_LSTM that was used on WT-103 (Wikitext-103). \n\ndrop_mult is a hyper-parameter that defines by how much we want to multiply the dropout layers of our network. Dropout refers to dropping out units in the network(both hidden and visible) to avoid overfitting the network. \n\ndrop_mult = 0.3 means all dropout layers\'s probability will be multiplied by 0.3. drop_mult = 1.5 means all dropout layers\'s probability will be multiplied by 1.5. AWD_LSTM has a dropout in every layer, so this parameter is quite important.\n\nTo understand it simply, if model is overfitting, increase drop_mult.\nIf model is underfitting, decrease drop_mult.[/INST] ```\nlearn = language_model_learner(\n    data, AWD_LSTM, drop_mult=0.3, pretrained=wt103_path\n)\n\n``` \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'}]

It is identified by two channel identifiers that are unique within each detector module and encode the position, much like column/row numbers of a matrix. A cell can provide signal information that the detector module has recorded in addition to the position.

The GIF below demonstrates convolution in action.\n\n\n\nThe above process can be summarized with an equation, where *f* is the image and *h* is the kernel. The dimensions of *f* are *(m, n)* and the kernel is a square matrix with dimensions smaller than *f*:\n\n\n\n\nIn the above equation, the kernel *h* is moving across the length and breadth of the image. The dot product of *h* with a sub-matrix or window of matrix *f* is taken at each step, hence the double summation (rows and columns). I have always remembered from the revered Andrew Ng about how he taught us about what convolutional layers do.\n\n> In the beginning, the conv layers are of low level abstraction, detailing a image's features such as shapes and sizes.

As the conv layers go later, it will pick up on many abstract features, which is not really easily distinguished by human eyes.\n\nBelow, we see an example of horizontal and vertical filters.[/INST] ```\n# Convolution Layers\n\n# Convolution is a rather simple algorithm which involves a kernel (a 2D matrix) which moves over the entire image, calculating dot products with each window along the way. The GIF below demonstrates convolution in action.\n\n\n\n# The above process can be summarized with an equation, where f is the image and h is the kernel. The dimensions of f are (m, n) and the kernel is a square matrix with dimensions smaller than f:\n\n\n\n\n# In the above equation, the kernel h is moving across the length and breadth of the image. The dot product of h with a sub-matrix or window of matrix f is taken at each step, hence the double summation (rows and columns). I have always remembered from the revered Andrew Ng about how he taught us about what convolutional layers do.\n\n> In the beginning, the conv layers are of low level abstraction, detailing a image's features such as shapes and sizes. In particular, he described to us the horizontal and vertical conv filters. As the conv layers go later, it will pick up on many abstract features, which is not really easily distinguished by human eyes.\n"}]

Though gender bias is decreasing across categories, the rate of decrease needs improvement for enhancing diversity, fairness and balanced emotions. Finally, we performed sentiment analysis to study sentiment trends - a strong signal for trustworthiness.Sentiments Learning 😃 😔\nIn the ever-evolving field of artificial intelligence, the sentiments expressed by researchers hold great significance. They reflect the emotions of AI technology and development trends, which can shape the occurrence of situations like "AI Winters"[31]. AI winters signify a decline in public and industry interest in AI, subsequently leading to a decrease in funding for AI projects. Such downturns often arise from concerns related to scalability, transparency, robustness, accountability, and the societal impact of AI models. Michael Woolridge, an Oxford University professor, explores the history of AI in his book [32] "A Brief History of Artificial Intelligence: What It Is, When We Are, and Where We Are Going" . He highlights previous instances of AI winters, notably during the periods of 1950–1970 and 1980–1990. In the early 1970s, the first AI winter occurred due to a variety of reasons, including exaggerated expectations, difficult technological issues, and ethical dilemmas. The second AI winter occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s due to multiple factors, including the fall of the LISP machine market and the emergence of expert systems [33]. Woolridge further suggests that the next AI winter may arise when the general public becomes disillusioned with the technology. It\'s noteworthy that the launch of ChatGPT in 2022 left researchers, the public, and the industry in awe of its generative AI capabilities. However, ethical concerns, such as hallucinations generated by ChatGPT, also emerged as a significant aspect. To ensure the long-term sustainability of AI and avoid the negative impact of future AI winters, it is crucial to learn from both the positive and negative aspects of the technology. By understanding the sentiments expressed in research publications, we can gain early signals of potential AI winter threats and improve AI ethics practice.\n\nWe have employed the distilbert-base-uncased-fine tuned-sst-2-english model for our analysis. This model was fine-tuned on the SST-2 dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/sst2) achieving an accuracy of 91.3% . We have utilized this large language model to predict the sentiments of paper titles. Our focus was primarily on two sentiment classes: positive and negative.\n\nTo gain insights, we calculated sentiment trends both on a yearly basis and within specific categories (cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.CL, stat.ML) (Figure 12). To examine the trajectory of positive sentiments, we applied statistical methods, specifically Generalized Additive Models (GAM), which allowed us to fit smoothed curves. Additionally, we conducted statistical tests (chi-square test), to assess potential biases present in positive and negative sentiments.\n\nFor the category "cs.AI," the proportions of positive sentiments range from approximately 57% to 62% across different years. In the category "cs.LG," the proportions of positive sentiments range from approximately 51% to 56%. For the category "stat.ML," the proportions of positive sentiments range from approximately 45% to 69%.\n\nIn the category "cs.CV," the proportions of positive sentiments range from approximately 48% to 61%. Similar to "stat.ML," Lastly, in the category "cs.CL," the proportions of positive sentiments range from approximately 51% to 59%.  Overall, these observations suggest that sentiment proportions vary across different categories, but in none of the categories, there is a consistent significant bias towards positive or negative sentiments. We further performed the statistical test (chi-square), and found a p-value greater than 0.05, further confirming that there is no statistically significant difference between positive and negative sentiment.

All subjects from site 2 were assigned to the test set, so their scores are not available. While there are fewer site 2 subjects than site 1 subjects in the test set, the total number of subjects from site 2 will not be revealed until after the end of the competition. To make it more interesting, the IDs of some site 2 subjects have been revealed below. Use this to inform your models about site effects. Site effects are a form of bias. To generalize well, models should learn features that are not related to or driven by site effects.\n\n\n\n## Important blogs, research papers and kaggle discussions\n\n* https://www.kaggle.com/c/trends-assessment-prediction/discussion/145818\n* https://www.kaggle.com/c/trends-assessment-prediction/discussion/145791\n* https://www.kaggle.com/c/trends-assessment-prediction/discussion/145597\n* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181933/\n* https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066572\n* https://www.kaggle.com/c/trends-assessment-prediction/discussion/146205# Preliminaries\nNow Let's Begin by Importing the data[/INST] ```\n# Importing the data\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\nimport h5py\nimport nibabel as nib\nimport nilearn\nfrom nilearn import image\nfrom nilearn import input_data\nfrom nilearn import datasets\nfrom nilearn import plotting\nfrom nilearn import masking\nfrom nilearn import surface\nfrom nilearn import datasets\nfrom nilearn import image\nfrom nilearn import input_data\nfrom nilearn import datasets\nfrom nilearn import image\nfrom nilearn import input_data\nfrom nilearn import datasets\nfrom nilearn import image\nfrom nilearn import input_data\nfrom nilearn import datasets\nfrom nilearn import image\nfrom nilearn import input_data\nfrom nilearn import datasets\nfrom nilearn import image\nfrom nilearn import input_data\nfrom nilearn import datasets\nfrom nilearn import image\nfrom nilearn import input_data\nfrom nilearn import datasets\nfrom nilearn import image\nfrom nilearn import input_data\nfrom nilearn import datasets\nfrom nile"}]

(NOTE: The diffusion pattern looks patchy... probably due to smaller bounding boxes)\n* Regarding Other Lesion (CLASS-ID: 9)\n    * Heatmap distribution is incredibly diffuse and covers most of the image, the focus is towards a vertical-strip in the centre of the image.\n* Regarding Pleural Effusion (CLASS-ID: 10)\n    * Heatmap distribution is lung shaped (slightly more rectangular?) and relatively diffuse, the focus is towards the bottom of the lungs and although both lungs are covered, the left lung has a stronger focus.\n* Regarding Pleural Thickening (CLASS-ID: 11)\n    * Heatmap distribution is vaguely lung shaped (patches near top and focus trails down exterior lung edge fading as it goes), the focus is towards the top of the lungs is oval (horizontal).\n* Regarding Pneumothorax (CLASS-ID: 12)\n    * Heatmap distribution is lung shaped (more rectangular), the focus is on the entire left lung however the right lung has some diffuse coverage.\n* Regarding Pulmonary Fibrosis (CLASS-ID: 13)\n    * Heatmap distribution is vaguely lung shaped (patches near top and focus trails down lung fading as it goes), the focus is towards the top of the lung and it is oval.\n[/INST] ```\n# PLOT HEATMAP REPRESENTING BOUNDING BOXES FOR VARIOUS CLASSES\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 15))\n\n# Aortic Enlargement (CLASS-ID: 0)\nax.imshow(\n    np.transpose(\n        np.reshape(\n            np.transpose(\n                np.reshape(\n                    np.transpose(\n                        np.reshape(\n                            np.transpose(\n                                np.reshape(\n                                    np.transpose(\n                                        np.reshape(\n                                            np.transpose(\n                                                np.reshape(\n                                                    np.transpose(\n                                                        np.reshape(\n                                                            np.transpose(\n                                                                np.reshape(\n                                                                    np.transpose(\n                                                                        np.reshape(\n                                                                            np.transpose(\n                                                                                np.reshape(\n                                "}]

Especially I am in Love with NLP & DL.\n\nFirst of all, I would like to say all of you "Thanks!" for the fact that you find my ideas interesting and useful!\n\n- [[TPU-Inference] Super Fast XLMRoberta](https://www.kaggle.com/shonenkov/tpu-inference-super-fast-xlmroberta)\n- [NLP Albumentations](https://www.kaggle.com/shonenkov/nlp-albumentations)\n- [Hack with Parallel Corpus](https://www.kaggle.com/shonenkov/hack-with-parallel-corpus)\n\nIn this kernel I would like to demonstrate simple technique for keeping balance class during distributed training with PyTorch / XLA\n# Motivation\n\nI\'ve studied the best of the best provided public training kernels for this competition and understood, that authors didn\'t use balance class:\n- [I Like Clean TPU Training Kernels & I Can Not Lie](https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek/i-like-clean-tpu-training-kernels-i-can-not-lie) by [@abhishek](https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek)\n- [Jigsaw Multilingual Toxicity : EDA + Models 🤬](https://www.kaggle.com/tarunpaparaju/jigsaw-multilingual-toxicity-eda-models) by [@tarunpaparaju](https://www.kaggle.com/tarunpaparaju)\n- [Deep Learning For NLP: Zero To Transformers & BERT](https://www.kaggle.com/tanulsingh077/deep-learning-for-nlp-zero-to-transformers-bert) by [@tanulsingh077](https://www.kaggle.com/tanulsingh077)\n\n\nThanks a lot all of them for their works!\n\n\n[@xhlulu](https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu) said in [discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-multilingual-toxic-comment-classification/discussion/140254):\n\n> Balance your data: The training data set consists of over 2M data points, but it is heavily unbalanced since it only has around 120k positive labels. In order to limit training time, I selected all of the positive labels, and subsampled the negative labels such that I have in total 400k labels, which is a lot closer to the class frequency of the validation labels.\n\n\nI also think the balance class gives really good boost in this competition!\n\nYou can see how [@xhlulu](https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu) realized balance class keeping:\n- [Jigsaw TPU: XLM-Roberta](https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/jigsaw-tpu-xlm-roberta) by [@xhlulu](https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu)\n\n\nHe used sampler with pandas DataFrame:\n\n\n\nIt has some problems: not all data can participate in training! Also If you used this method in every epoch you can find OOM problems that often meet with XLA / PyTorch# MAIN IDEA\n\nLets use modificated pytorch sampler for our loaders for retrieve balanced dataset in streaming! \nAlso lets don\'t forget about distributed training!\n\nI would like to demostrate technique how I decided this problem for my research pipelines.### I would like to say thanks [Catalyst Team](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst) for creating the great library!\n\nBut this library can\'t use TPU backend for now... \n\nSo let\'s start![/INST] ```\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nimport torch.optim as optim\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset\nfrom torch.utils.data.distributed import DistributedSampler\nfrom torch.utils.data.sampler import RandomSampler\nfrom torch.utils.data.sampler import SequentialSampler\nfrom torch.utils.data.sampler import SubsetRandomSampler\nfrom torch.utils.data.sampler import WeightedRandomSampler\nfrom torch.utils.data.sampler import WeightedSubsetRandomSampler\nfrom torch.utils.data.sampler import WeightedSequentialSampler\nfrom torch.utils.data.sampler import WeightedSubsetSequentialSampler\nfrom torch.utils.data.sampler import WeightedSubsetRandomSampler\nfrom torch.utils.data.sampler import WeightedSubsetSequentialSampler\nfrom torch.utils.data.sampler import WeightedSubsetRandomSampler\nfrom torch.'}]

Feature Engineering\n\n\nSince we have multiple keystroke logs for each essay and need to aggregate them for our machine learning model, our feature engineering approach should focus on summarizing the information across all logs per essay. Here are some aggregated feature suggestions:\n\n1. **Basic Statistical Features:**\n    - Calculate basic statistics for time-related fields (`action_time`) for each user/essay like `mean`, `median`, `std`, `min`, `max`, `skew`, etc. These features can provide insights into the user's typing behavior and speed.\n    \n1. **Count-Based Features:**\n    - **Number of activities per category (Nonproduction, Input, Remove/Cut, etc.) for each essay:** It shows how much editing, writing, and correcting happened.\n    - **Total number of activities for each essay:** which might capture how much effort was put into the essay.\n \n1. **Time-Based Features:**\n    - **Total time taken to write the essay** (difference between the first and last event time). Total Writing Time: Total time spent on writing the essay = Sum of all session durations per essay or The time difference between the first and last event.\n    - **Average Time per Event or Specific Activity Category**: Average time per event or specific activity category, which might indicate the thought process involved. For each essay and each activity category, calculate the average `action_time`.

It includes cleaning and formatting the data before feeding into a machine learning algorithm. For NLP, the preprocessing steps are comprised of the following tasks:\n\n1. **Tokenizing the string:** To tokenize means to split the strings into individual words without blanks or tabs.\n\n2. **Lowercasing:** In this step, we will also convert each word in the string to lower case.\n\n3. **Removing stop words and punctuation:**\n\nSince we have a Twitter dataset, we\'d like to remove some substrings commonly used on the platform like the hashtag, retweet marks, and hyperlinks. We\'ll use the re library to perform regular expression operations on our tweet. We\'ll define our search pattern and use the sub() method to remove matches by substituting with an empty character (i.e. \'\').\n\n4. **Stemming:** Stemming is the process of converting a word to its most general form, or stem. This helps in reducing the size of our vocabulary.\n\nConsider the words: \n * **learn**\n * **learn**ing\n * **learn**ed\n * **learn**t\n \nAll these words are stemmed from its common root **learn**. However, in some cases, the stemming process produces words that are not correct spellings of the root word. For example, **happi** and **sunni**. That\'s because it chooses the most common stem for related words. For example, we can look at the set of words that comprises the different forms of happy:\n\n * **happ**y\n * **happi**ness\n * **happi**er\n \nWe can see that the prefix **happi** is more commonly used. We cannot choose **happ** because it is the stem of unrelated words like **happen**.\n \nNLTK has different modules for stemming but in this kernel i will be using the PorterStemmer.[/INST] ```\n# Preprocess raw text for Sentiment analysis\n\n# Tokenizing the string\n# Lowercasing\n# Removing stop words and punctuation\n# Stemming\n\n# Tokenizing the string\nstop_words = set(stopwords.words("english"))\n\n\ndef preprocess(tweet):\n    # Tokenizing the string\n    tokens = word_tokenize(tweet)\n    # Lowercasing\n    tokens = [token.lower() for token in tokens]\n    # Removing stop words and punctuation\n    tokens = [\n        token\n        for token in tokens\n        if token not in stop_words and token not in string.punctuation\n    ]\n    # Stemming\n    stemmer = PorterStemmer()\n    tokens = [stemmer.stem(token) for token in tokens]\n    return tokens\n\n\n# Preprocess raw text for Sentiment analysis\n\n# Tokenizing the string\n# Lowercasing\n# Removing stop words and punctuation\n# Stemming\n\n# Tokenizing the string\nstop_words = set(stopwords.words("english'}]

In many cases, this can be reduced to simply stacking together layers:[/INST] ```\n# Build the model\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(64, activation="relu", input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)))\nmodel.add(Dense(64, activation="relu"))\nmodel.add(Dense(1))\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(loss="mean_squared_error", optimizer="adam")\n\n``` \n\n### Train the model\n\nTraining the model involves feeding the training data to the model, then adjusting the model\'s weights to minimize the loss function. This process is typically repeated many times, with the model\'s weights being updated after each iteration.\n\nIn Keras, training a model involves calling the `fit` method on the model, passing in the training data and the number of epochs to train for. The `fit` method will then iterate over the training data, feeding each sample to the model, and adjusting the model\'s weights as needed to minimize the loss function.\n\nHere\'s an example of how to train a model in Keras:\n```\n# Train the model\nmodel'}]

Please wrap your code using ```.\n<</SYS>>\n\n## 5. Definición de la función que extrae las respuestas\n\nEl segundo componente principal de nuestro enfoque es el sistema de Q&A. Dada una pregunta en lenguaje natural y un párrafo, este sistema extraerá la respuesta del párrafo o devolverá "No sé". La implementación de este sistema se basará en el Q&A extractivo visto en clase.\n\nEn esta sección, primero definiremos la función principal que responderá a la pregunta (`extract_answers`): dada una pregunta y un objeto `dataFrame` con párrafos (devueltos por la función `retrieve_docs()`), y el número máximo de respuestas a obtener y la longitud máxima de la respuesta indicada, extraerá las respuestas específicas de todos los párrafos.\n\nEsta función agregará las mejores respuestas para cada párrafo (en una lista de respuestas de Python) al objeto `dataFrame` de entrada. La respuesta tendrá la siguiente información (en un `dict` de python): el texto de la respuesta en sí (`answer`), la puntuación (`score`) y las posiciones inicial y final de la respuesta en el párrafo (`start `,`end`).A continuación se muestran los encabezados de funciones que deberás completar:\n\n- `def extract_answers(qstring, df_results, n_answers, max_answer_len)`\n- `def run_qa(pregunta, contexto, nmejor, max_answer_len)`\n\nPuedes usar el sistema de Q&A basado en el [modelo de lenguaje SciBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10676) y el modelo Q&A [fine-tuneado](https://www.kaggle.com/jonander95/bertsquadquac). El modelo se creó utilizando los conjuntos de datos [SQuAD2.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03822) y [QuAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07036). El modelo está agregado al notebook en `/kaggle/input/bertsquadquac/checkpoint-42000/`. Puedes usar el siguiente códigos para cargar:\n```\ntokenizador = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(\'/kaggle/input/bertsquadquac/checkpoint-42000/\')\nmodelo = BertForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(\'/kaggle/input/bertsquadquac/checkpoint-42000/\')\n```\n\nEl modelo está entrenado para responder `CANNOTANSWER` cuando no encuentra una respuesta posible. Para hacer esto, deberás agregar la cadena `CANNOTANSWER` al párrafo de entrada antes de usar el modelo QA y quitarlo después de usar el modelo para recuperar el contexto original.\n\nTambién puedes explorar otros modelos de la sección de modelos huggingface. Por ejemplo:\n\n- `deepset/roberta-base-squad2-covid`[/INST] ```\ndef extract_answers(qstring, df_results, n_answers, max_answer_len):\n    """\n    Extracts the answers from the given dataframe\n    """\n    # Initialize the list of answers\n    answers = []\n\n    # Iterate over the results\n    for i, row in df_results.iterrows():\n        # Get the context and the answer\n        context = row["context"]\n        answer = row["answer"]\n\n        # Check if the answer is not CANNOTANSWER\n        if answer!= "CANNOTANSWER":\n            # Add the answer to the list of answers\n            answers.append(\n                {\n                    "answer": answer,\n                    "score": row["score"],\n                    "start": row["start"],\n                    "end": row["end"],\n                }\n            )\n\n    # Sort the answers by score\n    answers = sorted(answers, key=lambda x: x["score"], reverse=True)\n\n    # Extract the top n answers\n    answers = answers[:n_answers]\n\n    # Initialize the list'}]

By just replacing the spatial convolutions with global self-attention in the final three bottleneck blocks of a ResNet and no other changes, our approach improves upon the baselines significantly on instance segmentation and object detection while also reducing the parameters, with minimal overhead in latency. Through the design of BoTNet, we also point out how **ResNet bottleneck blocks with self-attention can be viewed as Transformer blocks**. Without any bells and whistles, BoTNet achieves 44.4% Mask AP and 49.7% Box AP on the COCO Instance Segmentation benchmark using the Mask R-CNN framework; surpassing the previous best published single model and single scale results of ResNeSt evaluated on the COCO validation set. Finally, we present a simple adaptation of the BoTNet design for image classification, resulting in models that achieve a strong performance of 84.7% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet benchmark while being up to 2.33x faster in compute time than the popular EfficientNet models on TPU-v3 hardware. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a strong baseline for future research in self-attention models for vision.\n\n*Bottleneck Transformers for Visual Recognition*: https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11605\n\nInstall Required PackagesImport Packages[/INST] ```\n# Install required packages\n!pip install -q transformers==4.16.2\n!pip install -q timm==0.4.1\n\n# Import packages\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nimport torchvision\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\nimport torchvision.models as models\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport time\nimport os\nimport json\nimport random\nimport math\nimport copy\nimport warnings\nimport cv2\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score, confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.utils import shuffle\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_curve\nfrom sklearn.metrics import auc\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\nfrom sklearn.met'}]

In recent decades however, electricity has entered the market as a tradeable commodity and the power industry of many countries has been **deregulated**. In Spain, the Electric Power Act 54/1997 exposed all of the stakeholders to **high amounts of uncertainty** as the price of electricity is determined by countless factors and also, due to the fact that electricity cannot be stored in large quantities efficiently [[1]](#ref1). With the emergence of this new market, the need for reliable forecasting methods at all scales (hourly, daily, long-term, etc.) has also emerged and has become a large area of research.\n\nThe goal of this kernel is to compare different **deep neural network architectures** (+XGBoost) on the task of **predicting the next hour's electricity price** by using the past values of the electricity price as well as those of another features related to energy generation and weather conditions. Furthermore, the kernel contains a meticulous *exploration and cleaning* of the data, *time series analysis* of the electricity price and careful *feature engineering*. With further research and development (e.g. as a forecasting model which is updated in real-time) a similar approach could possibly prove useful to all the stakeholders (electric power companies, investors, etc.) involved in energy markets. For the time being, I believe that this kernel can serve as a **future reference** for aspiring data scientists, as it contains an *end-to-end time series forecasting project* and demonstrates the -minimum- level of immersion that a dataset needs in order to turn into something which is actually applicable in the real world.\n\nIn the **original project**, which was conducted for a postgraduate course, I compared the performance (using the Root Mean Squared Error as the performance metric) of 5 different architectures (LSTM, stacked LSTM, CNN, CNN-LSTM and Time Distributed MLP) for both univariate and multivariate forecasting (i.e. using only the previous time-steps of the electricity price vs. also using other features) using a different number of previous time-steps as the features for the models (3, 10 and 25 previous time-steps for all the used features). In **this particular kernel**, you will find an application of all the aforementioned deep learning architecures, as well as two more approaches: the *Encoder-Decoder* architecure and the *XGBoost regressor*. Furthermore, in all these applications, I use the 25 previous time-steps of all the features (multivariate forecasting) that have been extracted or generated, after applying *PCA (Principal Component Analysis)*. The **Adam optimizer** is used in all the deep learning architectures and, in order to choose its learning rate, I originally conducted preliminary tests using the the *learning rate scheduler* callback starting from a learning rate equal to 0.0001 and gradually increasing it by a factor of 10 every 10 epochs; a step which is omitted in this kernel.\n# Table of Contents\n\n- [1.

The probabilities are very polarized (one very high and the rest very low), indicating that the model is making these predictions with great confidence. The semi-supervised weights seem to set this model apart from EfficientNet. The red and blue bars are, once again, more prominent in the last (fourth) leaf labeled "multiple_diseases". This is probably because leaves with multiple diseases may show symptoms of rust and scab as well, thus slightly confusing the model.### Generate submission[/INST] ```\nsubmission = pd.DataFrame(\n    {\n        "Id": test_df["Id"],\n        "Label": np.argmax(\n            np.array(\n                [\n                    np.array(\n                        np.array(\n                            np.array(\n                                np.array(\n                                    np.array(\n                                        np.array(\n                                            np.array(\n                                                np.array(\n                                                    np.array(\n                                                        np.array(\n                                                            np.array(\n                                                                np.array(\n                                                                    np.array(\n                                                                        np.array(\n                                                                            np.array(\n                                                                                np.array(\n                                                                                    np.array(\n                                                                                        np.array(\n                                                                                            np.array(\n                                                                                                np.array(\n                                                                                                    np.array(\n                                                                                                        np.array(\n                                                                                                            np.'}]

If you think I left out something or would like to expand on this work, please feel free to do so. Lastly, if you find this notebook helpful, please leave an upvote 👍 so that this work can reach a wider audience.### Part 1: Imports and Setup\nMost of these imports are quite standard (e.g., `pandas`, `tqdm`, `matplotlib`), and you have likely used these yourselves. Since the dataset sizes in this competition are fairly large, it might also be worth considering `polars` (a fast, Rust-based alternative to `pandas`), but since many here are more familiar with `pandas`, that's what I'll use here.[/INST] ```\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport time\nimport warnings\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom tqdm.notebook import tqdm\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Perceptron\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import RidgeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import RidgeClassifierCV\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import PassiveAggressiveClassifier\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegressionCV\n"}]

Please wrap your code using ```.\n<</SYS>>\n\nWe can understand these parameters by looking at their relationship to the *weights* and *activations* of the layer. Let\'s do that now.\n\n## Weights ##\n\nThe **weights** a convnet learns during training are primarily contained in its convolutional layers. These weights we call **kernels**. We can represent them as small arrays:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA kernel operates by scanning over an image and producing a *weighted sum* of pixel values. In this way, a kernel will act sort of like a polarized lens, emphasizing or deemphasizing certain patterns of information.\n\n\n\n\nA kernel acts as a kind of lens.\n\n\nKernels define how a convolutional layer is connected to the layer that follows. The kernel above will connect each neuron in the output to nine neurons in the input. By setting the dimensions of the kernels with `kernel_size`, you are telling the convnet how to form these connections. Most often, a kernel will have odd-numbered dimensions -- like `kernel_size=(3, 3)` or `(5, 5)` -- so that a single pixel sits at the center, but this is not a requirement.\n\nThe kernels in a convolutional layer determine what kinds of features it creates. During training, a convnet tries to learn what features it needs to solve the classification problem. This means finding the best values for its kernels.\n\n\n\n## Activations ##\n\nThe **activations** in the network we call **feature maps**. They are what result when we apply a filter to an image; they contain the visual features the kernel extracts. Here are a few kernels pictured with feature maps they produced.\n\n\nKernels and features.\n\n\nFrom the pattern of numbers in the kernel, you can tell the kinds of feature maps it creates. Generally, what a convolution accentuates in its inputs will match the shape of the *positive* numbers in the kernel. The left and middle kernels above will both filter for horizontal shapes.\n\nWith the `filters` parameter, you tell the convolutional layer how many feature maps you want it to create as output.\n\n# Detect with ReLU #\n\nAfter filtering, the feature maps pass through the activation function. The **rectifier function** has a graph like this:\n\n\n\n\nThe graph of the rectifier function looks like a line with the negative part "rectified" to 0.\n\n\nA neuron with a rectifier attached is called a *rectified linear unit*. For that reason, we might also call the rectifier function the **ReLU activation** or even the ReLU function.\n\nThe ReLU activation can be defined in its own `Activation` layer, but most often you\'ll just include it as the activation function of `Conv2D`.[/INST] ```\n# Detect with ReLU\n\n# Define the model\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(\n    Conv2D(\n        filters=32,\n        kernel_size=(3, 3),\n        activation="relu",\n        input_shape=(img_height, img_width, 3),\n    )\n)\nmodel.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))\nmodel.add(\n    Conv2D(\n        filters=64, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation="relu", padding="same"\n    )\n)\nmodel.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))\nmodel.add(\n    Conv2D(\n        filters=128, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation="relu", padding="same"\n    )\n)\nmodel.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))\nmodel.add(\n    Conv2D(\n        filters=128, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation'}]

First we try matrix completion using **probabalistic PCA** using the aptly named package "PCA Magic" which implements the ideas in [this paper](https://www.apps.stat.vt.edu/leman/VTCourses/PPCA.pdf). As described in the [package repository](https://github.com/allentran/pca-magic):\n\n>A better way: suppose you had the latent factors representing the matrix. Construct a linear model for each series and then use the resulting model for interpolation. Intuitively, this will preserve the signal from the data as the interpolated values come from latent factors. However, the problem is you never have these factors to begin with. The old chicken and egg problem. But no matter, fixed point algorithms via Probabilistic PCA to the rescue.\n\nThe algorithm does not scale well with N so we break up the stock universe into chunks and then combine them at the end. There is *some* information loss in doing this.\n\nI recently watched [**"Handling Missing Values"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYySNJU8qR0) session on Abhishek Thakur\'s YouTube channel featuring [Rob Mulla](). The final section in that session talks about iteratively imputing missing values. He uses code by Kaggle master [RabotniKuma](https://www.kaggle.com/analokamus) which uses LightGBM as the imputer. This a really creative application of LightGBM and it dramatically outperforms imputation by probabalistic PCA. Let\'s see![/INST] ```\n# Matrix Completion of Missing Targets\n# Probabalistic PCA vs. LGBMImputer\n\n# A better way: suppose you had the latent factors representing the matrix.\n# Construct a linear model for each series and then use the resulting model for interpolation.\n# Intuitively, this will preserve the signal from the data as the interpolated values come from latent factors.\n# However, the problem is you never have these factors to begin with.\n# The old chicken and egg problem.

I think improving `content_rmse` leds to improve the overall score as well.\nIn this notebook, I'll check whether the accuracy of `woring score` can be improved by combining features related to NLP.\n\n### Feature Engineering\n\n`prompt_text`と`text`の間に見られる類似性に関する特徴はwording_scoreに関係あるかもしれない。そこで、下記の特徴量を作成する。\n\nFeatures related to the similarity found between `prompt_text` and `text` may be related to the wording_score. Therefore, I'll create following features.\n\n[Using features]\n\n- Text Length\n- Length Ratio\n- Word Overlap\n- N-grams Co-occurrence\n- Quotes Overlap\n- Grammar Check\n  - spelling: pyspellchecker\n\n\n\n### Model Architecture\n\n図のような構成のモデルを作成する。\n\n\n\n今回は、wording_rmseを向上させることを目的に、NLPに関する特徴量とLGBMを組み合わせる。\n\n### References\n\n- https://www.kaggle.com/code/kieserel/deberta-additional-features\n- https://www.kaggle.com/code/vassylkorzh/feature-engineering\n\n### My previous notebooks\n\n- https://www.kaggle.com/code/tsunotsuno/debertav3-baseline-content-and-wording-models\n- https://www.kaggle.com/code/tsunotsuno/debertav3-w-prompt-title-question-fields\n- https://www.kaggle.com/code/tsunotsuno/debertav3-with-llama2-example\n[/INST] ```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport re\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\nfrom nltk.corpus import wordnet\nfrom nltk.corpus import names\nfrom nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn\nfrom nltk.corpus import brown\nfrom nltk.corpus import conll2000\nfrom nltk.corpus import treebank\nfrom nltk.corpus import gutenberg\nfrom nltk.corpus import brown\nfrom nltk.corpus import treebank\nfrom nltk.corpus import gutenberg\nfrom nltk.corpus import brown\nfrom nltk.corpus import treebank\nfrom nltk.corpus import gutenberg\nfrom nltk.corpus import brown\nfrom nltk.corpus import treebank\nfrom nltk.corpus import gutenberg\nfrom nltk.corpus import brown\nfrom"}]

The ReLU activation says that negative values are not important and so sets them to 0. ("Everything unimportant is equally unimportant.")\n\nHere is ReLU applied the feature maps above. Notice how it succeeds at isolating the features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike other activation functions, the ReLU function is **nonlinear**. Essentially this means that the total effect of all the layers in the network becomes different than what you would get by just adding the effects together -- which would be the same as what you could achieve with only a single layer. The nonlinearity ensures features will combine in interesting ways as they move deeper into the network.

"can you reconstruct the pixels missing on this patch?"\n- from video clip: "which one of this to frame comes first in the video?"\n- tabular data: "can you reconstruct the missing features?"\n\n## Why self supervision?\n\nVery often, labelling data is either expensive or very time consuming. Only a small percentage of the available data have labels, and you can only use this small portion of data with supervised algorithms. With the help of self supervision you can use the information of your unlabeled data to pretrain your model. What you are hoping for is that in order to be able to solve the puzzle you created on unlabelled data, your model will need to learn some fundamental concept from your data.\n\n## How does TabNetPretrainer works?\n\nThe current implementation is very close to the one proposed in tabnet research paper, the only difference being that I decided to take the mean of the given loss per batch in order to get consistant results with different batch sizes (instead of summing everything). See original paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07442\n\nThere is a new class named `TabNetPretrainer` which globally have the same parameters than `TabNetRegressor`, `TabNetClassifier` or `TabNetMultiTaskClassifier`.\nThere is only one more parameter for the `fit` method which is `pretraining_ratio`, a floating point between 0 and 1 that decides how hard is the puzzle you are trying to solve. If `pretraining_ratio=0.8` it means you are asking the model to reconstruct 80% of the feature from 20% you did not mask. Masks are random and created during training at the batch level.\n\nYou need to call `fit` on some dataset to perform self supervised pretraining. You can also give another dataset in order to perform early stopping to avoid overfitting.\n\nThen you can start from the pretrained weights by giving the pretrainer to `from_unsupervised` parameter in the `fit` (note that this would work for `TabNetRegressor`, `TabNetClassifier` or `TabNetMultiTaskClassifier` as only the final layer differs for those networks).\n\nNote : this version of code solves the retraining bug mentionned here : https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/discussion/196830\nNote 2 : you won\'t be able to resuse previously saved pytorch-tabnet model with this version because the body of the network has been refactorize in order to keep the code clean with this addition.\n\n## Where does the code come from?\nThe pytorchtabnetpretraining dataset used here is just a copy paste of the code from this Pull Request : https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/tabnet/pull/220\n\nThis has not been merged yet because I consider that it has not been tested nor reviewed enough. You are using this at your own risk (but I\'m confident that things are working as expected). I\'ll merge the PR in a few days after careful review, please feel free to share your thoughts about this either in the comments here or directly in the PR : https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/tabnet/pull/220\n\n## What is the boost on performance?\n\nI haven\'t spend much time on this competition, so I don\'t have a strong pipeline to share.\n\nHowever I tried to follow the CV scheme from Chris Deotte (https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/discussion/195195) so that people can compare this more easily.\n\nFrom the very small experience I did with the same params and 5 fold CV (without using control group):\n- No pretraining : CV 0.01841, LB 0.01951\n- With pretraining (pretraining_ratio 0.8): CV 0.01754, LB 0.01887\n\nSo it might be useful for some of you who have a stronger pipeline!\nPlease let me know if it helped!\n## Package installation[/INST] ```\npip install git+https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/pytorch-tabnetpretraining.git\n\n``` \n\n# Self Supervision with pytorch-tabnet\n\n## What is self supervision?\n\nIn machine learning, we are talking about self supervision when you train a supervised algorithm with labels which you created artificially.\nIt\'s often a reconstruction game, where you don\'t have labels but you mask some information from the data itself to the model and then try to predict the information you masked. \n\nSome examples:\n- for computer vision, the labels can be "what is the rotation degree applied to this image?" "can you reconstruct the pixels missing on this patch?"\n- from video clip: "which one of this to frame comes first in the video?"\n- tabular data: "can you reconstruct the missing features?"\n\n## Why self supervision?\n\nVery often, labelling data is either expensive or very time consuming. Only a small percentage of the available data have labels, and you can only use this small portion of data with supervised algorithms. With the help of self supervision you'}]

In this kernel, I have explained 3D convolutions and their implementation on 3D MNIST dataset. Later in this kernel, I have shown how to use 3D convolution layers on one of the breakthrough and important area of Healthcare : Drug Discovery\n\n### What are Convolutions? \n\n- Mathematically, A convolution is an integration function that expresses the amount of overlap of one function g as it is shifted over another function f.   \n- Intutively, A convolution acts as a blender that mixes one function with another to give reduced data space while preserving the information.    \n\nIn terms of Neural Networks and Deep Learning:\n- Convolutions are filter (matrix / vectors) with learnable parameters that are used to extract low-dimentional features from an input data.     \n- They have the property to preserve the spatial or positional relationships between input data points  \n- Convolutional neural networks exploits the spatially-local correlation by enforcing a local connectivity pattern between neurons of adjacent layers.    \n- Intutively, convolution is the step of applying the concept of sliding window (a filter with learnable weights) over the input and producing a weighted sum (of weights and input) as the output. The weighted sum is the feature space which is used as the input for the next layers.  \n\nFor example, in Face Recognization problem, first few convolution layers learns the pressence of key points in the input image, next convolution layers learns the edges and shapes, and final convolution layers learns the face.  In this example, the input space is first reduced to lower dimentional space (representing information about points / pixels), then this space is reduced to another space containing (edges / shapes) and finally it is reduced to classify faces in the images. Convolutions can be applied in N dimentions.  \n\n### Types of Convolutions : \n\nLet's discuss what are different types of convolutions \n\n### 1D Convolutions\n\nMost simplistic convolutions are 1D convolutionals are generally used on sequence datasets (but can be used for other use-cases as well). They can be used for extracting local 1D subsequences from the input sequences and identify local patterns within the window of convolution. The following image shows how a 1 D convolution filter is applied to a sequence to obtain new features. Other common uses of 1D convolutions are seen in the area of NLP where every sentence is represented as a sequence of words.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n### 2D Convolutions \n\nOn image datasets, mostly 2D Convolutional filters are used in CNN architectures. The main idea of 2D convolutions is that the the convolutional filter moves in 2-directions (x,y) to calculate low dimentional features from the image data. The output shape is also a 2 dimentional matrix. \n\n\n\n### 3D Convolutions\n\n3D convolutions applies a 3 dimentional filter to the dataset and the filter moves 3-direction (x, y, z) to calcuate the low level feature representations. Their output shape is a 3 dimentional volume space such as cube or cuboid. They are helpful in event detection in videos, 3D medical images etc. They are not limited to 3d space but can also be applied to 2d space inputs such as images.  \n\n\n\nLets implement the 3D CNN on 3D Mnist dataset. First, lets import the key libraries. \n\nAdditionally, there are other types of convolutions as well: \n\n### Dilated Convolutions  \n\nDilated or Altrous convolutions defines the spacing between the values in a kernel. In this type of convolution, the receptive view of the kernels increases due to the spacing, For example a 3x3 kernel with a dilation rate of 2 will have the same field of view as a 5x5 kernel. The complexity remains the same but different features are generated in this case. \n\n\n\nLet's now create a 3D convolutional neural network architecture on 3D mnist dataset.

Simultaneously, it also orchestrates a custom callback, offering a fertile ground for experimental pursuits.\n\nHyperparameters are the pre-set configurations that govern the training process. They can influence the model\'s performance significantly and may include aspects such as learning rate, batch size, number of layers, number of units per layer, and more.\n\nDespite their importance, there is no "one-size-fits-all" set of hyperparameters that can guarantee the optimal performance across different problems. The efficacy of hyperparameters is heavily contingent on the nature of the data and the specific problem at hand. Hence, it is often necessary to experiment with different sets of hyperparameters to find the most suitable configuration for the task, a process known as hyperparameter tuning.\n\nAdjusting the baseline hyperparameter values can provide valuable insights into their influence on model performance. Such experimental exploration can contribute towards enhancing the understanding of their role in model training and improving model performance.\n\nThe custom callback configured in this part of the code plays a vital role in monitoring the model\'s training process. By specifying the conditions under which the training should be modified or halted, the custom callback provides a way to further fine-tune the model and its training process.\n\n- **Define Hyperparameters**:\n    - `batch_size`: The number of samples per gradient update, set to 40.\n    - `epochs`: Number of epochs to train the model, set to 40.\n    - `patience`: The number of epochs with no improvement after which learning rate will be reduced, set to 1.\n    - `stop_patience`: Number of epochs with no improvement after which training will be stopped, set to 3.\n    - `threshold`: Metric threshold for switching monitoring metric, set to 0.9.\n    - `factor`: Factor by which the learning rate will be reduced, set to 0.5.\n    - `ask_epoch`: Epoch number to ask for early stopping, set to 5.\n    - `batches`: The number of batches per epoch, calculated as the ceiling of the total number of training samples divided by the batch size.\n\n- **Set Up Callbacks**:\n    - `callbacks`: Initializes a list of callbacks to be used during training. In this case, it includes an instance of the `MyCallback` class, initialized with the model and the above hyperparameters.[/INST] ```\nbatch_size = 40\nepochs = 40\npatience = 1\nstop_patience = 3\nthreshold = 0.9\nfactor = 0.5\nask_epoch = 5\nbatches = int(np.ceil(len(train_data) / batch_size))\n\ncallbacks = [\n    MyCallback(\n        model,\n        batches,\n        batch_size,\n        epochs,\n        patience,\n        stop_patience,\n        threshold,\n        factor,\n        ask_epoch,\n    )\n]\n\n``` \n\nThis code defines the hyperparameters for the model and sets up the callbacks to be used during training. The `MyCallback` class is defined in the previous section of the code.\n\nThe `MyCallback` class is a custom callback that monitors the model\'s training process and adjusts the learning rate and early stopping based on the monitored metric. The callback is initialized with the model, the number of batches per epoch, the batch size, the number of epochs, the patience, the stop patience, the threshold'}]

Building the Generator Model \n\n\nAs we explored in the previous articles we mentioned a couple of times that the GANs consist of two main components which are the generator and the discrimination.\n\nIn this section, we will build the generator model whose input will be a noise vector (z). The generator architecture is shown in the figure below.\n\nThe first layer is a fully connected layer that is then reshaped into a deep, narrow layer in the original DCGAN paper the authors reshaped\nthe input to 4 × 4 × 1024. Here we will use 7 × 7 × 128.\n\nThen we use the upsampling layer to double the feature\nmap dimensions from 7 × 7 to 14 × 14 and then again to 28 × 28. In this network, we use three convolutional layers. We will also use batch normalization and a ReLU activation.\n\nFor each of these layers, the general scheme is convolution ⇒ batch normalization ⇒ ReLU. We keep stacking up layers like this until we get the final transposed convolution layer with the shape 28 × 28 × 1.\n\n\n\nHere is Kera’s code to build the generator model shown in the image above:[/INST] ```\ndef generator(z):\n    x = layers.Dense(1024, activation="relu")(z)\n    x = layers.Reshape((7, 7, 128))(x)\n    x = layers.UpSampling2D((2, 2))(x)\n    x = layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation="relu", padding="same")(x)\n    x = layers.BatchNormalization()(x)\n    x = layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation="relu", padding="same")(x)\n    x = layers.BatchNormalization()(x)\n    x = layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation="relu", padding="same")(x)\n    x = layers.BatchNormalization()(x)\n    x = layers.Conv2DTranspose(1, (3, 3), strides=(2, 2), padding="same")(x)\n    return x\n\n``` \n\n\n\n\n\n'}]

This will be discussed more in the section on training further down.\n\n---\n\nInside the scope, everything is defined in the same way it would be outside the distribution strategy. There is, however, a particularity about the loss function which we will discuss further down as well.\n\n**In the next cell, we instantiate the learning rate function, the loss object, and the model(s) inside the scope**\n\n\n📖 \xa0 REFERENCE:\n    - TPUStrategy - Scope\n    - Tutorial - Custom Training With TPUs\n[/INST] ```\n# Instantiate the learning rate function, the loss object, and the model(s) inside the scope\n\n```\n## 5.6 HOW TO USE TPU TO TRAIN MODELS\n\nIn order to use TPU to train models, you will need to use the **`tf.distribute.TPUStrategy`** object.\n\n---\n\nHere is the rule of thumb:\n\n---\n\n* To use TPU to train a model, you will need to create a **`tf.distribute.TPUStrategy`** object, and then use the **`strategy.run()`** method to run the training loop.\n* The **`strategy.run()`** method will automatically distribute the computation across the TPUs.\n* The **`strategy.run()`** method takes a function as an argument, which will be executed in parallel across the TPUs.\n* The function should take a **`tf.distribute.DistributedValues`** object as an argument, which will contain the input data for the model.\n* The function should return a **`tf.distribute.DistributedValues`** object"}]

As stated earlier, we can clearly see that the sales data is very erratic and volatile. Sometimes, the sales are zero for a few days in a row, and at other times, it remains at its peak value for a few days. Therefore, we need some sort of "denoising" techniques to find the underlying trends in the sales data and make forecasts.## Denoising \n\nNow, I will show how these volatile sales prices can be denoised in order to extract underlying trends. This method may lose some information from the original time series, but it may be useful in extracting certain features regarding the trends in the time series.### Wavelet denoising\n\nWavelet denoising (usually used with electric signals) is a way to remove the unnecessary noise from a time series. This method calculates coefficients called the "wavelet coefficients". These coefficients decide which pieces of information to keep (signal) and which ones to discard (noise).\n\nWe make use of the MAD (mean absolute deviation) value to understand the randomness in the sales and accordingly decide the minimum threshold for the wavelet coefficients in the time series.

It does not perform any sophisticated parsing or analysis of the input string.\n\nThe `nltk.word_tokenize()` function is often used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval. It is a useful tool for preprocessing text data before applying NLP techniques to it.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the `nltk.word_tokenize()` function is not always reliable, and it may not handle all types of input strings correctly.

Introduction\n\nStack Overflow is the largest, most trusted online community for developers to learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers. More than 50 million professional and aspiring programmers visit Stack Overflow each month to help solve coding problems, develop new skills, and find job opportunities. Stack Overflow partners with businesses to help them understand, hire, engage, and enable the world's developers. Our products and services focus on developer marketing, technical recruiting, market research, and enterprise knowledge sharing. Learn more about our business solutions here.\n\nEach year, Stack Overflow ask the developer community about everything from their favorite technologies to their job preferences. This year marks the eighth year they’ve published their Annual Developer Survey results—with the largest number of respondents yet. Over 100,000 developers took the 30-minute survey in January 2018.\n\nThis year, Stack Overflow covered a few new topics ranging from artificial intelligence to ethics in coding. They also found that underrepresented groups in tech responded to our survey at even lower rates than they would expect from their participation in the workforce. We are going to dive into the results ourselves and see what we can learn about salaries or machine learning or diversity in tech?# 2. Goals\n* Do a comprehensive EDA of Stack Overflow.\n* Apply well-thought visualizations to bringout insights. #  3.

These values are softmaxed to obtain attention probabilities. The tensors are then interpolated by these probabilities, then concatenated back to a single tensor.\n\nFinally, the result tensor with the last dimension as value_dim can take an linear projection and return.\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n**Multi-head attention consists of four parts:**\n*    Linear layers and split into heads.\n*    Scaled dot-product attention.\n*    Concatenation of heads.\n*    Final linear layer.\n\n---\n\nEach multi-head attention block gets three inputs;\n* **`Q` (query)**\n* **`K` (key)**\n* **`V` (value)**\n\nThese are put through linear (**`Dense`**) layers and split up into multiple heads. \n\nThe **`scaled_dot_product_attention`** defined above is applied to each head (broadcasted for efficiency). \n* An appropriate mask must be used in the attention step.  \n* The attention output for each head is then concatenated (using **`tf.transpose`**, and **`tf.reshape`**) and put through a final **`Dense`** layer\n\nInstead of one single attention head, **`Q`**, **`K`**, and **`V`** are split into multiple heads because it allows the model to jointly attend to information at different positions from different representational spaces. \n\nAfter the split each head has a reduced dimensionality, so the total computation cost is the same as a single head attention with full dimensionality.\n\n---\n\nLet\'s create a **`MultiHeadAttention`** layer to try out. \n* At each location in the sequence, **`y`**, the **`MultiHeadAttention`** runs all **`8`** attention heads across all other locations in the sequence, returning a new vector of the same length at each location.[/INST] ```\nclass MultiHeadAttention(tf.keras.layers.Layer):\n    def __init__(self, num_heads, key_dim, value_dim, dropout=0.1):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.num_heads = num_heads\n        self.key_dim = key_dim\n        self.value_dim = value_dim\n        self.dropout = dropout\n\n    def build(self, input_shape):\n        self.query_dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(self.key_dim * self.num_heads)\n        self.key_dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(self.key_dim * self.num_heads)\n        self.value_dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(self.value_dim * self.num_heads)\n        self.dropout = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(self.dropout)\n        self.final_dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(self.value_dim)\n\n    def'}]

Please wrap your code using ```.\n<</SYS>>\n\n## Problem Statement\n\n\n\nA brain tumor is a mass or growth of abnormal cells in your brain.\nMany different types of brain tumors exist. Some brain tumors are noncancerous (benign), and some brain tumors are cancerous (malignant). Brain tumors can begin in your brain (primary brain tumors), or cancer can begin in other parts of your body and spread to your brain as secondary (metastatic) brain tumors.\nHow quickly a brain tumor grows can vary greatly. The growth rate as well as the location of a brain tumor determines how it will affect the function of your nervous system.\nBrain tumor treatment options depend on the type of brain tumor you have, as well as its size and location.\n\nOur goal now is to design a deep learning system based on both vision transformers and Convolutional neural networks and compare both of them using different metrics.## Convolutional Neural Network\n\nIn deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of artificial neural network (ANN), most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery. CNNs are also known as Shift Invariant or Space Invariant Artificial Neural Networks (SIANN), based on the shared-weight architecture of the convolution kernels or filters that slide along input features and provide translation-equivariant responses known as feature maps. Counter-intuitively, most convolutional neural networks are not invariant to translation, due to the downsampling operation they apply to the input. They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, image segmentation, medical image analysis, natural language processing, brain–computer interfaces, and financial time series.\n\n\n\nCNNs are regularized versions of multilayer perceptrons. Multilayer perceptrons usually mean fully connected networks, that is, each neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer. The "full connectivity" of these networks make them prone to overfitting data. Typical ways of regularization, or preventing overfitting, include: penalizing parameters during training (such as weight decay) or trimming connectivity (skipped connections, dropout, etc.) CNNs take a different approach towards regularization: they take advantage of the hierarchical pattern in data and assemble patterns of increasing complexity using smaller and simpler patterns embossed in their filters. Therefore, on a scale of connectivity and complexity, CNNs are on the lower extreme. ## Vision Transformers(ViT)\n\nThe concept of Vision Transformer (ViT) is an extension of the original concept of Transformer. It is only the application of Transformer in the image domain with slight modification in the implementation in order to handle the different data modality. More specifically, a ViT uses different methods for tokenization and embedding. However, the generic architecture remains the same. An input image is split into a set of image patches, called visual tokens. The visual tokens are embedded into a set of encoded vectors of fixed dimension. The position of a patch in the image is embedded along with the encoded vector and fed into the transformer encoder network which is essentially the same as the one responsible for processing the text input. \n\n\n\nThere are multiple blocks in the ViT encoder and each block consists of three major processing elements: Layer Norm, Multi-head Attention Network (MSP) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP).

This will allow us to ask questions about our documents (that were not included in the training data), without fine-tunning the Large Language Model (LLM).\nWhen using RAG, if you are given a question, you first do a retrieval step to fetch any relevant documents from a special database, a vector database where these documents were indexed. \n\n## Definitions\n\n* LLM - Large Language Model  \n* Llama 2.0 - LLM from Meta \n* Langchain - a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using LLMs\n* Vector database - a database that organizes data through high-dimmensional vectors  \n* ChromaDB - vector database  \n* RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation (see below more details about RAGs)\n\n## Model details\n\n* **Model**: Llama 2  \n* **Variation**: 7b-chat-hf  (7b: 7B dimm. hf: HuggingFace build)\n* **Version**: V1  \n* **Framework**: PyTorch  \n\nLlaMA 2 model is pretrained and fine-tuned with 2 Trillion tokens and 7 to 70 Billion parameters which makes it one of the powerful open source models. It is a highly improvement over LlaMA 1 model.\n\n\n## What is a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system?\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) has proven their ability to understand context and provide accurate answers to various NLP tasks, including summarization, Q&A, when prompted. While being able to provide very good answers to questions about information that they were trained with, they tend to hallucinate when the topic is about information that they do "not know", i.e. was not included in their training data. Retrieval Augmented Generation combines external resources with LLMs. The main two components of a RAG are therefore a retriever and a generator.  \n \nThe retriever part can be described as a system that is able to encode our data so that can be easily retrieved the relevant parts of it upon queriying it. The encoding is done using text embeddings, i.e. a model trained to create a vector representation of the information. The best option for implementing a retriever is a vector database. As vector database, there are multiple options, both open source or commercial products. Few examples are ChromaDB, Mevius, FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate. Our option in this Notebook will be a local instance of ChromaDB (persistent).\n\nFor the generator part, the obvious option is a LLM. In this Notebook we will use a quantized LLaMA v2 model, from the Kaggle Models collection.  \n\nThe orchestration of the retriever and generator will be done using Langchain. A specialized function from Langchain allows us to create the receiver-generator in one line of code.\n\n## More about this  \n\nDo you want to learn more?

So shall we start writing our training code?\n\nWe are not using any wrapper class like Keras for Tensorflow, PyTorchLightning for PyTorch, we are going to write the training code ourselves from scratch. We won't regret mastering writing the Trainer code for pytorch, it would help you a ton with theoretical understanding with lavishness. \n\n- `model.train()` and `model.eval()` are called respectively on Training and Evaluation phase.\n- Intialise Loss and Accuracy Variable of the epochs to zero\n- Passing an `dataloader` object to a interative function we get Image Data and Label in batches for every loop\n- Transfer the `Data` and `label` to GPU if available\n- If it's Training Phase, we find Gradients and perform Back Progation for that we write the code under `torch.set_grad_enabled()` to instruct the PyTorch to consider the parameters for Backpropagation updation.\n- Feed in the `Data` (X) to the `model` and it will output `outputs` (Y).\n- Calculate the loss using `label` and `outputs` using criterion `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` \n- With the loss, we can now find the gradients and perform Backprogation using `loss.backward()` and optimizer `optim.Adam()` with defined LR\n- `optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR()` will update the LR based on the parameters defined.\n- Find the epoch accuracy and epoch loss for both training and validation phase.\n- Additionally we find validation kappa score. Kappa score is a trusted metric for evaluating Medical AI Models. You can learn more about [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/interpretation-of-kappa-values-2acd1ca7b18f)\n\n**Note : Important step while training in PyTorch is `optimizer.zero_grad()` because PyTorch haves caches of gradients in the memory, we have to zero that out while each step.**\n\n\n#### Early Stopping\nEarly Stopping is a method of choosing the best performed model with given conditions. Generally the conditions would be Best Validation Accuracy or Lowest Validation Loss. For this model, I choose the model with lowest validation loss for better reliable results from the model. Because more medical model is gonna diagnose a person, we dont want a false positive or false negative. \n\nTo do that we will check for lowest validation loss at every epoch and save the model parameters weights into a object and finally load the weights to the model using `model.load_state_dict()`.[/INST] ```\n# Training\n\n# model.train() and model.eval() are called respectively on Training and Evaluation phase.\n\n# Intialise Loss and Accuracy Variable of the epochs to zero\n\n# Passing an dataloader object to a interative function we get Image Data and Label in batches for every loop\n\n# Transfer the Data and label to GPU if available\n\n# If it's Training Phase, we find Gradients and perform Back Progation for that we write the code under torch.set_grad_enabled() to instruct the PyTorch to consider the parameters for Backpropagation updation.\n\n# Feed in the Data (X) to the model and it will output outputs (Y).\n\n# Calculate the loss using label and outputs using criterion nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\n\n# With the loss, we can now find the gradients and perform Backprogation using loss.backward() and optimizer optim.Adam() with defined LR\n\n# optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR() will update the LR based on the parameters defined.\n\n# Find the epoch accuracy and"}]

Please wrap your code using ```.\n<</SYS>>\n\n\n# Hyperdrive into PyTorch - Tutorial (Dive into Computer Vision in Health Care)\nYeah, as you guessed I am a huge fan of **Star Wars**. Maybe, I learn Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning to build my own C-3PO like the young Anakin Skywalker did but I would build a Bot for Health Care to help Humans in saving the Humanity. As it is the need of the time in this dreadful pandemic. Ok, lets consider building an Bot like see in Star Wars, ability to process what it sees will be our first priority right? Else our C-3PO will be blind 😂. \n\nComputer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables machines the ability to "See" things. The word "See" is not what you think of it as just what a camera do, capturing moments. But thats not it, "See" means that machine can able to perceive things and understands the difference or relation between the real world physical entities. This state of "See" is we achieved now takes a lot of hard word, research and iterations. We achieved it by solving little pieces of it like Image Classification, Image Segmentation and Object Segmentation, etc. \n\n> We are so blessed to be born in this period, as we have a plethora of resesources and community of people to guide us through.\n\n### Why AI in Health Care is crucial?\nThough many fields can be benificial by the implementation of Artificial Intelligence, it is the field of Health Care which would be benifitted the most and in turn Humanity. It very hard to diagnose X-ray scans, and take decisions deterministically at the right momemt. There is also human errors associated with it. Computers can contribute a ton to Health and Medicine as an "SideKick" to humans(Doctors). I wouldn\'t say Computer can outperform with absolute percision, it may have fail in some cases. That\'s why we have computers to assist Doctors.\n\n\n\nIf you find this notebook helpful please do upvote this notebook. It would make me smile and motivate me.\nSince you already starting reading **Kaggle Notebooks**, I assume you may have come across this Deep Learning library that is familiar with most Data Scientists and AI Researchers. \n\n\n## PyTorch\n\nPyTorch is a Deep Learning library which makes Tensor Computations, a core part in Deep Learning applications. It is developed and used by Facebook AI Research Lab. It has been library which attracted many researchers and develop many State-of-the-Art Algorithms across all the fields of Deep Learning such as Computer Vision, NLP and Tabular Data Processing. \n\n### Why learn PyTorch?\nPyTorch is home for many powerful projects and future researches in Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence. FaceBook AI Research (FAIR) contributed an enormous amount of new mind boggling researches and projects built o PyTorch. Detectron2(CV), HugginngFace(NLP),DETR(CV) are some of amazing projects by them based on PyTorch. So you will be able to see and develop your own State-of-the-Art applications inspiring from these projects. And also PyTorch is so friendly looking with most of the code will look like vanila "Python" Structures.\n> I learnt PyTorch after I got comfortable with Tensorflow/Keras. I think PyTorch has more flexibility for a coder and Customizable. I get to know the process behind the Traning of Model better with PyTorch.\n\n## Let\'s get started\nOk, I can hear you say "ENOUGH". Alright, let\'s get started in this notebook I am gonna guide you through a image classification task using PyTorch. So the problem statement that I am gonna take will be...# COVID-19 Detection using Chest Xray\nAs you probably know, we are in the tight hold of a pandemic which has its disastarous effect on this world. We are standing together even while physically distancing ourselves, protecting others and caring for others in this dreadful times. Humanity still deserved to live for million years. But we should contribute our role in this fight against an invisible enemy. \n\n> Many Data Scientist are working getting predictions and developing models for strategies. We can assist HealthCare workers and Doctors by developing a AI Assistment or Model. A Image Classification model can handle a lot of worries for Doctors, especially in X Ray Diagnosis.\n\nIn this notebook, I am going to train a CNN classifier which can classify COVID-19 Infected Lung Xray images from Healthy Lung Xray images. For that we need dataset from both classes, I used the dataset from two sources,\n\n- Cohen\'s [COVID Chest X-ray Dataset](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset) \n- Paul Mooney\'s [Chest X-ray Dataset (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)\n\n>😃 I am very grateful and thankful to the huge efforts by the Open-Source Community for collecting data in a repository. This project would be possible without those repositories.\n\nI create the aggregate the images from those two repositories and get them ready for training.

It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, could not compete, and would be superseded. -- Stephen Hawking told the BBC Introduction \nA dark side lurks in AI\'s shadow. In a deeply saddening incident, a Belgian man chose to end his life after engaging in discussions about the future of climate change with an AI chatbot called Eliza. His wife\'s statement emphasizes that his life might have been saved if it weren\'t for Eliza [1]. This is not a single incident, as there have been other notable incidents and controversies from across the globe and timeframe have been observed for them (Figure 1, Figure 2). Falsely labeling an athlete as a criminal, Microsoft’s AI Chatbot Tay being trolled, Uber’s real-world testing going all wild, the UK losing thousands of COVID cases by exceeding the spreadsheet data limit, and a healthcare algorithm failing to flag Black patients [1]. Despite these concerning incidents, AI continued to gain widespread popularity. Chatgpt recently created the record of fastest growing consumer application with more than a 100 million estimated monthly active users in January 2023, just two months after launch [2]. Similarly, AI applications are being used for various consumer and commercial applications ranging from financial loan decision, human resources management, housing solutions, facial recognition and healthcare applications. While all the promise has been exciting, there has been caution advised as many of these applications have been noted to have significant bias such as racial discrimination in face recognition algorithms and AI based house lending practices. Even in healthcare, a recent study looking at AI based publications, found that white and male researchers\' scholarly works are cited disproportionately more often than other races and sexes, mainly in first and last authorship. Overall, this has led to somewhat of a trust deficit in the use of these applications and concerns around their ethical development [3].\nTo address these concerns, many countries and organizations across the world, including the European Union and the US government have proposed and adopted key [4,5] principles that should govern research, development and implementation of trustworthy AI [6].  Ethical and legal use of AI broadly spans across dimensions, which include ensuring trustworthy implementation of AI systems and the fairness of AI systems that should demonstrate reproducibility, privacy, transparency, and accountability [7,8].\nEach stage of research and implementation of an AI system, starting with the identification of a problem statement, data curation, model development and evaluation, and model deployment, needs to follow the key principles of ethics and trust [9–11]. Publications related to AI systems provide scientific evidence and significant insights into application of the key principles of AI trustworthiness including ethics and form the basis for effective dissemination of knowledge [12].\nIn recent years, significant efforts have been made to address these principles. For instance, the necessity of Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) approvals has been emphasized in multiple journals and preprint servers. Conferences, such as NeurIPS, have implemented requirements for researchers to include a "broader impact" statement in their research papers. Stanford University\'s Ethics and Society Review (ESR) mandates researchers to identify and mitigate potential risks posed by their AI research in order to secure funding [13].[/INST] ```\n# Ethical AI is all we need!!\nThe development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.

As a Data Scientist or ML Engineers we should cover the culture of development,  DNN understanding,  CI/CD, model deployment,  DevOps monitoring and etc.*\n\nBut lets talk more about neural networks, we need learn enough of them to understand and implement(from scratch or with tensorflow/pytorch) [basic neural networks](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/02/8-neural-network-architectures-machine-learning-researchers-need-learn.html)  such as:\n\n*   One and multi layer perceptron\n*   Feed-Forward\n*  Symmetrically Connected\n*  Convolutional\n*  Recurrent(and its subtype LSTM)\n\nOf course, you should have good understand of math behind the NN works, it can be gained with [math deep learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/).\n\n***For those who prefer Russian-speaking courses I would recommend to pass [dlcourse.ai](https://dlcourse.ai). You can find a lot of courses about Deep Learning, but the most bright are [dlcourse.ru](https://dlcourse.ru) (from Carnegie Mellon University and [ods.ai](https://ods.ai)) and [Coursera specification from deeplearning.ai](https://https://ru.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

Tensorflow-Keras Training Pipeline\n[Table of contents](#0.1)\n\nIn this section we will see how to **train Unet model using tensorflow-keras on TPU if the data is not in "Tfrecord format"**. We will use the [tf.data](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data) API in order to build our data pipeline. You can also train model  using tfrecords. Many great notebooks have been published for the same by [Marcos Novaes](https://www.kaggle.com/marcosnovaes) and [Geir Drange](https://www.kaggle.com/mistag).\n\nI am using Weights and Biases to log my result. I have included some step just in case is anyone wants to start with it.\n\nFirst we need to install [Pavel Yakubovskiy](https://github.com/qubvel) amazing library [segmentation_models](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models). This will make experimentation real quick for us. We are also going to install [Weights & Biases](https://www.wandb.com/) in order to log our results. This will help us to interactively visualize our training results.## 9.1 Configuration🔨\n### 9.1.1 Hardware Configuration (TPU/GPU/CPU)🔨\n[Table of contents](#0.1)\n\nWe will configure hardware accelerator here.

Given a corpus having V words, the co-occurrence matrix X will be a V x V matrix, where the i th row and j th column of X, X_ij denotes how many times word i has co-occurred with word j. An example co-occurrence matrix might look as follows.**\n\n**The co-occurrence matrix for the sentence “the cat sat on the mat” with a window size of 1. As you probably noticed it is a symmetric matrix. How do we get a metric that measures semantic similarity between words from this? For that, you will need three words at a time. Let me concretely lay down this statement.**\n\n**The behavior of P_ik/P_jk for various words Consider the entity P_ik/P_jk where P_ik = X_ik/X_i Here P_ik denotes the probability of seeing word i and k together, which is computed by dividing the number of times i and k appeared together (X_ik) by the total number of times word i appeared in the corpus (X_i). You can see that given two words, i.e. ice and steam, if the third word k (also called the “probe word”), is very similar to ice but irrelevant to steam (e.g. k=solid), P_ik/P_jk will be very high (>1), is very similar to steam but irrelevant to ice (e.g. k=gas), P_ik/P_jk will be very small (<1), is related or unrelated to either words, then P_ik/P_jk will be close to 1 So, if we can find a way to incorporate P_ik/P_jk to computing word vectors we will be achieving the goal of using global statistics when learning word vectors.**\n\n**Source Credits - https://towardsdatascience.com/light-on-math-ml-intuitive-guide-to-understanding-glove-embeddings-b13b4f19c010**[/INST] ```\n# The behavior of P_ik/P_jk for various words\n# Consider the entity P_ik/P_jk where P_ik = X_ik/X_i\n# P_ik denotes the probability of seeing word i and k together, which is computed by dividing the number of times i and k appeared together (X_ik) by the total number of times word i appeared in the corpus (X_i)\n# You can see that given two words, i.e. ice and steam, if the third word k (also called the “probe word”), is very similar to ice but irrelevant to steam (e.g. k=solid), P_ik/P_jk will be very high (>1), is very similar to steam but irrelevant to ice (e.g. k=gas), P_ik/P_jk will be very small (<1), is related or unrelated to either words, then P_ik/P_jk will be close to 1\n# So, if we can find a way to incorporate P_ik/P_jk to computing word vectors we will be achieving the goal of using global statistics when learning word vectors'}]

There are 50000 training images divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. . \n\nThe dataset was collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton and is available at [cs.totonto.edu](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) as well as through the datasets module in keras through the keras.datasets module.\n\nSimilar to any Machine Learning algorithm, neural networks also require the input data to be certain shape, size, and type.

First, each file need to be unpickled, then the independent variables and dependent variable are separate, next the dependent variables are separated in their respective colors channels and reshape according the size of the image, then the data are converted to a numpy array and transpose to reorganize the data from 3,32,32 to 32,32,3.

Do they attend\ninput regions locally or globally?**\n\nThe promise of self-attention is to enable the learning of contextual dependencies\nso that a model can attend to the regions of inputs which are the most salient w.r.t\nthe objective. From the above plots we can notice that different attention heads yield\ndifferent attention distances suggesting they use both local and global information\nfrom an image. But as we go deeper in the Transformer blocks the heads tend to\nfocus more on global aggregate information.\n\nInspired by [Raghu et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08810) we computed mean attention\ndistances over 1000 images randomly taken from the ImageNet-1k validation set and we\nrepeated the process for all the models mentioned at the beginning. Intrestingly, we\nnotice the following:\n\n* Pretraining with a larger dataset helps with more global attention spans:\n\n\n| Pretrained on ImageNet-21kFine-tuned on ImageNet-1k | Pretrained on ImageNet-1k |\n| :--: | :--: |\n|  |  |\n\n\n* When distilled from a CNN ViTs tend to have less global attention spans:\n\n\n| No distillation (ViT B-16 from DeiT) | Distilled ViT B-16 from DeiT |\n| :--: | :--: |\n|  |  |\n\nTo reproduce these plots, please refer to\n[this notebook](https://github.com/sayakpaul/probing-vits/blob/main/notebooks/mean-attention-distance-1k.ipynb).## Method II: Attention Rollout\n\n[Abnar et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00928) introduce "Attention rollout" for\nquantifying how information flow through self-attention layers of Transformer blocks.\nOriginal ViT authors use this method to investigate the learned representations, stating:\n\n> Briefly, we averaged attention weights of ViTL/16 across all heads and then recursively\nmultiplied the weight matrices of all layers. This accounts for the mixing of attention\nacross tokens through all layers.\n\nWe used\n[this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jeonsworld/ViT-pytorch/blob/main/visualize_attention_map.ipynb)\nand modified the attention rollout code from it for compatibility with our models.[/INST] ```\n# This is the code to reproduce the plots from the paper\n# https://github.com/jeonsworld/ViT-pytorch/blob/main/visualize_attention_map.ipynb\n\n# This is the code to reproduce the plots from the paper\n# https://github.com/jeonsworld/ViT-pytorch/blob/main/visualize_attention_map.ipynb\n\n# This is the code to reproduce the plots from the paper\n# https://github.com/jeonsworld/ViT-pytorch/blob/main/visualize_attention_map.ipynb\n\n# This is the code to reproduce the plots from the paper\n# https://github.com/jeonsworld/ViT-pytorch/blob/main/visualize_attention_map.ipynb\n\n# This is the code to reproduce the plots from the paper\n# https://github.com/jeonsworld/ViT-pytorch/blob/main/visualize_attention_map.ipynb\n\n# This is the code to reproduce the plots'}]

We have explored the architecture of EfficientNet, its training process, and its performance on a variety of datasets. We have also visualized some sample predictions made by the model.\n\nOverall, EfficientNet is a powerful and efficient model that can be used for a wide range of computer vision tasks. Its ability to achieve high accuracy with low computational cost makes it a valuable tool for many applications.\n\nWe hope this project has provided a useful introduction to EfficientNet and its applications in computer vision.

All popular transformer-based models are trained using a variant of language modeling, e.g. BERT with masked language modeling, GPT-2 with causal language modeling.# **Masked Language Modeling -**\n\nMasked language modeling is the task of masking tokens in a sequence with a masking token, and prompting the model to fill that mask with an appropriate token. This allows the model to attend to both the right context (tokens on the right of the mask) and the left context (tokens on the left of the mask).

In order to do this the notebook makes use architectures such as a **basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Pre-trained EfficientNet V2 B0** and finally the **Pre-trained Vision Transformer**.\n\n## 📁 Dataset\nThe dataset used in this notebook is know as International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) Skin Cancer Detection Dataset. The ISIC is an academia and industry partnership designed to facilitate the application of digital skin imaging to help reduce melanoma mortality. This notebook uses the Kaggle version of this dataset.\n\n**For more information check the following:**\n> - [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fanconic/skin-cancer-malignant-vs-benign)\n> - [The International Skin Imaging Collaboration](https://www.isic-archive.com/#!/topWithHeader/wideContentTop/main)\n\n### ⚕️ What is Skin Cancer?\nSkin cancer is the abnormal growth of skin cells and most often develops on skin exposed to the sun. This common form of cancer can also occur on areas of your skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight.\n\nCancer begins when healthy cells change and grow out of control, forming a mass called a tumor. A tumor can be cancerous or benign. Cancerous tumor are malignant, meaning they can grow and spread to other parts of the body. Benign tumors can become quite large, but they will not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of your body. Benign tumors have distinct, smooth, regular borders, while malignant tumors have irregular borders and grows faster than benign tumors.\n\n> **Read here for more:** [Skin Cancer (Non-Melanoma) Guide](https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/skin-cancer-non-melanoma/introduction#:~:text=About%20skin%20cancer&text=A%20cancerous%20tumor%20is%20malignant,most%20common%20type%20of%20cancer.)[/INST] ```\nimport os\nimport glob\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Activation\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten\nfrom tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint\nfrom tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical\nfrom tensorflow.keras.applications import EfficientNetB0\nfrom tensorflow.keras.applications.efficientnet import preprocess_input\nfrom tensorflow.keras.applications.vgg16 import VGG16\nfrom tensorflow.keras.applications.vgg16 import preprocess_input\nfrom tensorflow.keras.applications.vgg16 import decode_predictions\nfrom tensorflow.keras.applications.vgg16 import VGG16\nfrom tensorflow.keras.applications.vgg16 import decode_predictions\nfrom'}]

The resulting scaled data is stored in the `X` variable.\n\nThe `StandardScaler` is a good choice for clustering because it helps to reduce the impact of outliers and other anomalies in the data. It also helps to reduce the impact of non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable.\n\nIt's important to note that the `StandardScaler` is not suitable for all types of data. For example, it's not suitable for data with a large range of values, or data with a large number of features. In such cases, other types of feature scaling methods may be more appropriate."}]

The text normalization means the process of transforming the text into the canonical(or standard) form. Like, "ok" and "k" can be transformed to "okay", its canonical form.And another example is mapping of near identical words such as "preprocessing", "pre-processing" and "pre processing" to just "preprocessing".\n\nText normaliztion is too useful for noisy textssuch as social media comments, comment to blog posts, text messages, where abbreviations, misspellings, and the use out-of-vocabulary(oov) are prevalent.# Effects of normalizationText normalization has even been effective for analyzing highly unstructured clinical texts where physicians take notes in non-standard ways. We have also found it useful for topic extraction where near synonyms and spelling differences are common (like \'topic modelling\', \'topic modeling\', \'topic-modeling\', \'topic-modelling\').\n\nUnlike stemming and lemmatization, there is not a standard way to normalize texts. It typically depends on the task. For e.g, the way you would normalize clinical texts would arguably be different from how you normalize text messages.\n\nSome of the common approaches to text normalization include dictionary mappings, statistical machine translation (SMT) and spelling-correction based approaches.# Word CountI am assuming you have the understanding of tokenization,the first figure we can calculate is the word frequency.By word frequency we can find out how many times each tokens appear in the text. When talking about word frequency, we distinguished between types and tokens.Types are the distinct words in a corpus, whereas tokens are the words, including repeats. Let\'s see how this works in practice.\n\nLet\'s take an example for better understanding:\n\n“There is no need to panic. We need to work together, take small yet important measures to ensure self-protection,” the Prime Minister tweeted.\n\nHow many tokens and types are there in above sentences?\n\nLet\'s use Python for calculating these figures. First, tokenize the sentence by using the tokenizer which uses the non-alphabetic characters as a separator.\n\n[/INST] ```\nimport re\n\n# Tokenize the sentence\ntokens = re.split(r"[^\\w]", "There is no need to panic. We need to work together, take small yet important measures to ensure self-protection.")\n\n# Count the number of tokens\nprint(len(tokens))\n\n# Count the number of types\nprint(len(set(tokens)))\n\n``` \n\nThis code will give you the number of tokens and the number of types in the sentence.\n\n# Word Count\n\nThe word count is the number of words in a text. It is a fundamental measure of text length. The word count is calculated by counting the number of words in a text.\n\nThe word count is calculated by counting the number of words in a text.

But, it is not able to capture the short-term volatility in the sales as accurately as other methods. Maybe this method can be combined with other low-level forecasters to produce better results.## Exponential smoothing \n\nThe **exponential smoothing** method uses a different type of smoothing which differs from average smoothing. The previous time steps are exponentially weighted and added up to generate the forecast. The weights decay as we move further backwards in time. The model can be summarized as follows:\n\n\n\n\nIn the above equations, $\\alpha$ is the smoothing parameter. The forecast *yt+1* is a weighted average of all the observations in the series *y1, … ,yt*. The rate at which the weights decay is controlled by the parameter *α*. This method gives different weightage to different time steps, instead of giving the same weightage to all time steps (like the moving average method). This ensures that recent sales data is given more importance than old sales data while making the forecast. Now let us see how this new smoothing method performs on our miniature dataset. The training data is in blue, validation data in orange, and predictions in green.[/INST] ```\n# Exponential smoothing\n\n\ndef exponential_smoothing(data, alpha):\n    """\n    Exponential smoothing method\n    """\n    forecast = [data[0]]\n    for i in range(1, len(data)):\n        forecast.append(alpha * data[i] + (1 - alpha) * forecast[i - 1])\n    return forecast\n\n\n# Plot the data\nplt.plot(train_data, label="Training data")\nplt.plot(val_data, label="Validation data")\nplt.plot(\n    exponential_smoothing(train_data, 0.5),\n    label="Exponential smoothing (alpha = 0.5)",\n)\nplt.plot(\n    exponential_smoothing(train_data, 0.7),\n    label="Exponential smoothing (alpha = 0.7)",\n)\nplt.plot(\n    exponential_smoothing(train_data, 0.9),\n    label="Exponential smoothing (alpha = 0'}]

We need more complex models which use several time stamps to make forecasts.## Moving average \n\nThe **moving average** method is more complex than the naive approach. It calculates the mean sales over the previous 30 (or any other number)  days and forecasts that as the next day\'s sales. This method takes the previous 30 timesteps into consideration, and is therefore less prone to short term fluctuations than the naive approach. The model can be summarized as follows:\n\n\n\nIn the above equation, *yt+1* is tomorrow\'s sales. On the right hand side, all the sales for the previous 30 days are added up and divided by 30 to find the average. This forms the model\'s prediction, *yt+1*. Now let us see how this new model performs on our miniature dataset. The training data is in blue, validation data in orange, and predictions in green.[/INST] ```\n# Moving average\n\n\ndef moving_average(data, window):\n    return np.convolve(data, np.ones(window), "valid") / window\n\n\n# Training data\nplt.plot(train_sales, label="Training data")\n# Validation data\nplt.plot(val_sales, label="Validation data")\n# Predictions\nplt.plot(\n    moving_average(train_sales, 30),\n    label="Moving average (window=30)",\n    color="green",\n)\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n``` \n\nThe training data is in blue, validation data in orange, and predictions in green.

Model Building.\n4. Model Training and Prediction.\n5. Conclusion.\n\nThis exemple was simply taken in the book **Deep Learning with Keras**, *by Antonio Gulli and Sujit Pal, 2017.*\n## 1. Introduction.\n\nRNNs have been used extensively by the **natural language processing (NLP)** community for various applications. One such application is building language models. A language model allows us to predict the probability of a word in a text given the previous words. Language models are important for various higher level tasks such as machine translation, spelling correction, and so on.\n\nA side effect of the ability to predict the next word given previous words is a generative model that allows us to generate text by ***sampling from the output probabilities***. In language modeling, our input is typically a sequence of words and the output is a sequence of predicted words. The training data used is existing unlabeled text, where we set the label **y(t)** at time **t** to be the input **x(t+1)** at time **t+1**.\n\nWe will train a character based language model on the text of ***Alice in Wonderland*** to predict the next character given **10** previous characters. We have chosen to build a character-based model here because it has a smaller vocabulary and trains quicker. The idea is the same as using a **word-based language model**, except we use characters instead of words. We will then use the trained model to generate some text in the same style.\n\nLet's get started.[/INST] ```\n# Generating text for NLP using SimpleRNN with keras\n\n# Table of interest:\n# 1.

The most usual business hours are from Monday-Saturday, from 9:30AM-1:30PM and then again from 4:30PM-8PM.\n\nTherefore, the value of the \'business hour\' will be equal to \'2\' if the given hour is within the business hours, equal to \'1\' if the given hour is within the "siesta" in between and equal to \'0\' for all other given hours.[/INST] ```\n# Generate a feature that indicates whether a business is open or not in a given hour\n\n# Define the business hours\nbusiness_hours = [\n    (9, 30),\n    (13, 30),\n    (17, 30),\n    (19, 30),\n    (20, 30),\n    (21, 30),\n    (22, 30),\n    (23, 30),\n]\n\n# Define the "siesta" hours\nsiesta_hours = [\n    (12, 0),\n    (13, 0),\n    (14, 0),\n    (15, 0),\n    (16, 0),\n    (17, 0),\n    (18, 0),\n    (19, 0),\n    (20, 0),\n    (21, 0),\n    (22, 0),\n    (23, 0),\n]\n\n# Define the function that will generate the feature\n'}]

If you have any suggestions or remarks i would be glad to hear. \nSome sections were taken from cs231n homework, and various tutorials/kernels on-line.\n Based on this kernel I built an heavier model to maximize my score, I managed to score 99.971, top 9% - https://www.kaggle.com/shaygu/mnist-using-keras-improving-accuracy-13-99-96\nTo achieve said score I made a net with more parameters and optimized other parameters around it. I\'ve also tried to implement model ensambling but it didnt improve the result. I suspect the reason is that that there isnt enough variance between my models. \n I\'ve checked my model on the more challenging fashion mnist (further explained at https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist ), you can check my kernel: https://www.kaggle.com/shaygu/fashion-mnist-keras-cnn-94-99-71-on-mnist\n\n\n### Table of interest:\n> ### 1.

In this competition, contestants are challenged to diagnose plant diseases solely based on leaf images. The categories include "healthy", "scab", "rust", and "multiple diseases". Solving this problem is important because diagnosing plant diseases early can save tonnes of agricultural produce every year. This will benefit not only the general population by reducing hunger, but also the farmers by ensuring they get the harvest they deserve.\n\nIn this kernel, I will visualize the data with Matplotlib and Plotly and then demonstrate some important image processing and augmentation techniques using OpenCV. Finally, I will show how different pretrained Keras models, such as DenseNet and EfficientNet, can be used to solve the problem.\n\nPlease upvote this kernel if you like it. It motivates me to produce more quality content :)To get started, here is an excellent video about how data scientists use TensorFlow to detect diseases in Cassava plants in Africa:[/INST] ```\n# Introduction\n# Welcome to the "Plant Pathology 2020 - FGVC7" competition!\n# In this competition, contestants are challenged to diagnose plant diseases solely based on leaf images.\n# The categories include "healthy", "scab", "rust", and "multiple diseases".\n# Solving this problem is important because diagnosing plant diseases early can save tonnes of agricultural produce every year.\n# This will benefit not only the general population by reducing hunger, but also the farmers by ensuring they get the harvest they deserve.\n\n# Visualization\n# Let\'s start by visualizing the data with Matplotlib and Plotly.\n# We will use the following libraries:\n# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# import plotly.graph_objs as go\n# import plotly.offline as py\n# py.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\n# from plotly.offline import iplot\n# from plotly import tools\n# from plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot\n#'}]

It thus needs a custom solution.\n\n* One has to make an assumption that ethical and social commentary may largely be found in the main body of research articles, and thus a solution needs to support full text search capabilities, not just limited to Title and Abstract searches.\n\n* A solution needs to understand context (due to the generalability of the topic) and thus go beyond "elastic" type keyword searches. For instance, the solution needs to understand that "ethical" and "moral" fall under the same realm, and thus be able to search for content where "ethical/social" are not explicitly mentioned.\n\n* The solution needs to be fast, so that end users can quickly iterate and refine their searches, especially during these pressing times.\n\n# Solution\n*  An Ethics-only model solution is presented. The model can perform searches on three levels: (1)Title Search, (2) Abstract Search and (3)Full Text Search.\n\n* The model is optimized for understanding semanticity, and furthermore trained on a custom-created Annotated Dataset, specific to the sub-tasks of the topic.\n\n* The model gives ability the ability to the user to either limit or expand their search criteria.\n\n* Model is designed to be fast even with full-text searches, so that end-users can quickly iterate.\n    # Methodology\n\n* The input data was preprocessed using a fork of the code initially published https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/cord-19-eda-parse-json-and-generate-clean-csv by XingHanLu. The preprocessing code is available here:https://www.kaggle.com/ayan78/rawdataprocessor \n\n* The core of the model lies in embedding the entire corpus of documents. While there are many options, the most practical one involves using a sentence encoder. The sentence encoder chosen for this task is derived from the great work done by Nils Reimers and his team (https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers). Their models are trained to enhance semantic understanding and hence is a great starting point.\n\n* Initial testing on corpus titles and abstracts revealed good results. The model captured relevant results where titles did not have the words "ethical or social" in them. However, the results lacked breadth, where mostly the same results were coming up, irrespective of the search query.\n\n* To enhance breadth, I endeavored onto the laborious task of generating an Annotated Dataset. I took the 7 main sub-topics of the Ethics Task and started searching for content via web search for each of them. I then assigned a score ranging in [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1] for each search result. Each search result got 7 scores (i.e. how closely did the search result match to each of the 7 sub-topics based). I created a dataset with 1000 records. I also made sure that none of the searches were directly coming from the CORD corpus, in order to avoid any overfitting. Annotated Data can be found here:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/ayan78/stsbenchmark\n\n* The Annotated Dataset was then used to train the original sentence-transformer. The trained model was then used to generate the sentence embeddings for the full corpus. The model training code can be found here:https://www.kaggle.com/ayan78/ethicsdata-transformer\n\n* The sentence embedding process was becoming very lengthy, and hence to expedite the process I used extractive text summarization (bert-extractive-summarizer: https://github.com/dmmiller612/bert-extractive-summarizer). \n\n* Once embedding was done, I used the faiss indexer to index the embeddings. Faiss (https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) is designed for fast searching. I used cosine similarity to rank the searches.\n\n* Search Query results are presented in HTML format. Details below\n# Results\n\n* Results are capped at top 20 results. This can easily be changed by the end-user to either restrict or expand their search.\n* Search Results are provided in HTML format. Snapshot below:\n\n* HTML page has a wordcloud of all the text retrieved from the query.\n* This is followed by a list of titles which are linked to respective urls. If a url for a paper is missing, url links to a google search of the title.\n* The titles are followed by cord_uid and paper_id (sha) where available.\n* The user then has the option of reading the relevant content (related to the search query) within the article, This is via a toggle button shown below:\n\n* Results for each of the 7 sub-tasks can be found here:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/ayan78/ethics-results# Caveats and Next Steps\n\n* The main enhancement of the model came from the training on the Annotated Dataset. However this annotation was done by 1 person (yours truly) who is neither a knowledge expert or from the field. Also 1000 records is merely a drop in the ocean in terms of training size. An enhanced annotated dataset will go a long way in improving the model.\n\n* An empirical threshold is set at 0.6 of cosine similarity to determine whether a search is relevant or not. While this can also be changed by the user to restrict or enhance the results, and is infact done automatically by the model (depending on too many or too few results), a smarter way of thresholding would enhance the solution.\n\n* An extracrive summarizer is used to reduce the corpus, but perhaps an Abstractive Summarizer may work better. This needs to be determined.\n* The training is done in chunks to keep under the 9-hour kaggle limit. Some mechanism for auto-chunking would be nice.

In particular, all three of the columns which contain qualitative info for the condition of the weather seem to contain a large part of the duplicates that we found earlier in `df_weather`. From the above R-squared scores, it seems that keeping and one-hot encoding 'weather_description' or 'weather_main' is the best idea to get the most out of information in the dataset.

It looks like disaster tweets are written in a more formal way with longer words compared to non-disaster tweets because most of them are coming from news agencies. Non-disaster tweets have more typos than disaster tweets because they are coming from individual users.

We'll have to investigate this further. \n3. There are a LOT of features! Almost 5000! And they outnumber the number of rows in the training set!\n4. There are less than 5000 training rows. In fact, there are fewer rows than columns, which means we'll have to invest a lot of effort into feature selection / feature engineering. \n5. The memory size of the train dataset is fairly large - 170 MB, which is to be expected. \n6. Pandas is treating 1845 features as float, and 3147 as integer. It is possible that some of those int features are one-hot-encoded or label-encoded categorical variables. We'll have to investigate this later, and possibly do some reverse-engineering. :)\n7. There doesn't appear to be any missing values in the train set. This is, IMHO, overall a good thing, although a lot of times there is some signal in the missing values that's valuable and worth exploring. \n\nThis is going to be a very, very, interesting competition. :)\n\nNow let's take a look at the test dataset.[/INST] ```\ntest.info()\ntest.shape\ntest.memory_usage()\ntest.dtypes\ntest.describe()\ntest.columns\ntest.head()\ntest.tail()\ntest.isnull().sum()\ntest.isnull().sum() / len(test)\ntest.isnull().sum() / len(test) * 100\ntest.isnull().sum() / len(test) * 100\ntest.isnull().sum() / len(test) * 100\ntest.isnull().sum() / len(test) * 100\ntest.isnull().sum() / len(test) * 100\ntest.isnull().sum() / len(test) * 100\ntest.isnull().sum() / len(test) * 100\ntest.isnull().sum() / len(test) * 100\ntest.isnull().sum() / len(test) * 100\ntest.isnull().sum() / len(test) * 100\ntest.isnull().sum() / len(test)"}]

This is probably, once again, due to the limitations of the camera system. The camera can detect objects that are far ahead, but not too far to the side. And, it can also detect objects that are far to side, but not too far ahead. But, **the camera cannot detect objects that are both far ahead and far to the side**. Because of this, objects that are far ahead and far to the side are not detected at all, and only objects which satisfy one (or none) of those conditions are detected. This results in a negative relationship between *center_x* and *center_y*.### center_z**center_z** corresponds to the *xz* coordinate of the center of an object\'s location (bounding volume).

While considered the most dangerous type of skin cancer because of its ability to rapidly spread throughout the body, melanoma is generally very treatable if found early.2\nhttps://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-melanoma-514215\n\nThe[ Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM)](https://siim.org/page/about_siim) is the leading healthcare professional organization for those interested in the current and future use of informatics in medical imaging. The society's mission is to advance medical imaging informatics across the enterprise through education, research, and innovation in a multi-disciplinary community. The [International Skin Imaging Collaboration or \nISIC](https://siim.org/page/about_siim) Melanoma Project is an academia and industry partnership designed to facilitate the application of digital skin imaging to help reduce melanoma mortality\n\nThe overarching goal of the ISIC Melanoma Project is to support efforts to reduce melanoma-related deaths and unnecessary biopsies by improving the accuracy and efficiency of melanoma early detection since when recognized and treated in its earliest stages, melanoma is readily curable\n\n## Objective\n\nThe objective of this competition is to identify melanoma in images of skin lesions. In particular, we need to use images within the same patient and determine which are likely to represent a melanoma. In other words, we need to create a model which should predict the probability whether the lesion in the image is malignantor benign.Value 0 denotes benign, and 1 indicates malignant\n\n## Dataset\nThe dataset consists of images in :\n* DIOCOM format\n* JPEG format in JPEG directory\n* TFRecord format in tfrecords directory\n\nAdditionally, there is a metadata comprising of train, test and submission file in CSV format.\n\n## Understanding the Evaluation Metric\n\nFor this particluar problem, our submissions will be evaluated using **area under the ROC curve**. An ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) is a graph showing the performance of a classification model at all classification thresholds. This curve plots two parameters:\n\n\n\nAn ROC curve plots TPR vs. FPR at different classification thresholds. Lowering the classification threshold classifies more items as positive, thus increasing both False Positives and True Positives. The following figure shows a typical ROC curve.\n\n\n\nsource: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc\n# 1.

The submission file can then be uploaded to a competition platform such as Kaggle or GitHub to submit the predictions.'}]
