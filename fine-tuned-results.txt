Define the `search` function, which will be the main entry point for the search functionality.\n2. Inside the `search` function, define a `document_change` function that will be called whenever the user selects a different document from the dropdown menu. This function will update the information displayed in the result tab.\n3. Define a `render_tab` function that will be called to render the result tab. This function will take a `tab` object and a `r` object as input, and will update the tab\'s children and title.\n4. Define a `run_search` function that will be called when the user clicks the "Search" button. This function will perform the search and update the search results.\n5. Define a `search_text` widget, a `number_of_documents` widget, and a `run_button` widget. The `search_text` widget will allow the user to enter a search query, the `number_of_documents` widget will allow the user to specify the number of documents to return, and the `run_button` widget will allow the user to initiate the search.\n6. Define a `search_in_progress` label that will be displayed while the search is in progress.\n7. Define a `doc_select` widget that will be used to display the search results.\n8. Define a `result_tab` widget that will be used to display the search results.\n9.

Please wrap your code using ```.\n<</SYS>>\n\nThis code is a Python script that generates a submission for a Kaggle competition. It uses a Markov chain to generate a sequence of words that are likely to be relevant to the competition.\n\nHere\'s a step-by-step breakdown of the code:\n\n1. The first few lines import the necessary libraries, including NumPy, pandas, and the Kaggle API.\n2. The next block of code sets the random seed to 23, which is used to generate the Markov chain.\n3. The words variable is created by reading in a CSV file named "traink.Writeup.csv" and extracting the unique words from it.\n4. The rands variable is created by generating a random matrix of size (len(words), 3) and converting it to a DataFrame.\n5. The words variable is then concatenated with the rands variable, and the resulting DataFrame is converted to a dictionary.\n6. The seq variable is created by joining the values in the Writeup column of the traink DataFrame into a single string and splitting it into a list of words.\n7. The counts variable is created by counting the frequency of each word in the seq variable.\n8. The words dictionary is updated by averaging the values of the current word and the next word in the sequence.\n9. The first testing block of code is used to generate a submission for the competition. It first creates a DataFrame from the words dictionary and adds a "counts" column to it. It then sorts the DataFrame by the "dist" column and selects the top 255 words.\n10. The second testing block of code is used to generate a submission for the competition. It first creates a DataFrame from the bigrams of the Writeup column of the traink DataFrame. It then groups the DataFrame by the "w1" column and aggregates the "w2" column by joining the values.\n11. The out variable is created by starting with the "Winning" word and adding random words from the generated DataFrame until the length of the out variable is 255.\n12. The final step is to write the submission to a CSV file named "submission.csv".[/INST] ```\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport kaggle\n\nkaggle.api.authenticate()\n\nnp.random.seed(23)\n\nwords = pd.read_csv("traink.Writeup.csv")["Writeup"].str.split().explode()\n\nrands = np.random.rand(len(words), 3)\n\nwords = pd.DataFrame(\n    {\n        "word": words,\n        "r1": rands[:, 0],\n        "r2": rands[:, 1],\n        "r3": rands[:, 2],\n    }\n)\n\nwords = words.set_index("word").to_dict()["r1"]\n\nseq = " ".join(words.keys()).split()\n\ncounts = pd.Series(seq).value_counts()\n\nwords = {\n    word: (words[word] + words[word + " "]) / 2 for word in words if word + " " in words\n}\n\n# Testing\n\nsubmission = pd.DataFrame(\n    {\n        "Id'}]

Please wrap your code using ```.\n<</SYS>>\n\nThis code is a Python script that performs a series of operations on a dataset, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. The script uses several libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, to perform these operations.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the code:\n\n1. The script starts by importing the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.\n2. The script then defines a function called `OHE` (One-Hot Encoding) that takes in a dataset, a list of columns to encode, and a target column. The function performs one-hot encoding on the specified columns and returns the encoded dataset.\n3. The script then defines a table to store the results of the operations performed on the dataset.\n4. The script then loops through each column in the dataset that is considered "unimportant" (i.e., not used in the model).\n5. For each column, the script performs the following operations:\n\na. It concatenates the training and testing dataframes to create a single dataframe that contains both the training and testing data.\n\nb. It performs one-hot encoding on the column using the `pd.get_dummies` function.\n\nc. It calculates the number of unique values in the column using the `value_counts` function.\n\nd. It identifies the column with the minimum number of unique values.\n\ne. It drops the column with the minimum number of unique values from the one-hot encoded dataframe.\n\nf. It concatenates the one-hot encoded dataframe with the original dataframe.\n\ng. It drops the original column from the dataframe.\n\nh. It drops any duplicate columns from the dataframe.\n\ni. It splits the dataframe back into training and testing dataframes.\n\nj. It performs mean encoding on the target column using the `np.log1p` function.\n\nk. It performs linear regression on the mean encoded target column using the `LinearRegression` class from the `sklearn.linear_model` module.\n\nl. It calculates the mean absolute error (MAE) for the linear regression model using the `mean_absolute_error` function from the `sklearn.metrics` module.\n\nm. It adds a row to the table with the results of the linear regression model.\n\nn. It performs one-hot encoding on the cluster column using the `OHE` function.\n\no. It performs linear regression on the one-hot encoded cluster column using the `LinearRegression` class from the `sklearn.linear_model` module.\n\np. It calculates the MAE for the linear regression model using the `mean_absolute_error` function from the `sklearn.metrics` module.\n\nq.

The matrix() method takes a DataFrame as an argument, and returns a matrix plot of the missing values. The plot shows the missing values in a matrix format, with the rows representing the columns and the columns representing the rows. The cells in the matrix represent the missing values, and are colored based on the proportion of missing values in each cell.\n\nThe matrix() method also takes several optional arguments, such as the title, the color palette, and the font size. You can use these arguments to customize the plot to your liking.\n\nFor example, you can use the following code to create a matrix plot of the missing values in the titanic_df DataFrame, with a title, a color palette, and a font size of 12:\n```\nmsno.matrix'}]

The model\'s predictions on the validation and test data are then appended to a list, and the average and blended errors are calculated and printed.

It has several hyperparameters that can be tuned for better performance, such as the number of iterations, learning rate, depth, and colsample_bylevel. The code sets these hyperparameters to their default values, but you can experiment with different values to see if it improves the model\'s performance.\n\nThe code also uses the eval_metric parameter to specify the evaluation metric, which is the root mean squared error (RMSE) in this case. The code sets the random_seed parameter to a random value to ensure reproducibility.\n\nThe code uses the use_best_model parameter to use the best model found during the training process, which can improve the model\'s performance.

If the bounding boxes are not rectangular, or if there are other types of objects in the binary mask, the code may need to be modified to handle these cases.\n\nOverall, this code is a simple way to extract bounding boxes from a binary mask and display a sub-image of the original image that corresponds to'}]

The layer should have the following properties:\n\n* The input tensor should have a shape of (num_patches, num_channels)\n* The output tensor should have a shape of (num_patches, projection_dim)\n* The layer should use the Dense and Embedding layers from the Keras library to implement the projection and positional embedding\n* The layer should have a call method that takes a 2D tensor as input and returns a 2D tensor as output\n* The layer should have a num_patches and projection_dim attribute that are set in the constructor\n\nHere is an example of how to use the PatchEncoder layer in a Keras model:\n```\nmodel = tf.keras.Sequential([\n    PatchEncoder(num_patches=10, projection_dim=128),\n    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),\n    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation=\'relu\'),\n    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation=\'softmax\')\n])\n```\nIn this example, the PatchEncoder layer is used as the first layer in a Keras model.

The PatchEncoder layer applies a projection and positional embedding to the input tensor, and then flattens the output tensor to a 1D tensor before passing it through a series of dense layers. The final output of the model is a 1D tensor with a shape of (10,).[/INST] ```\nclass PatchEncoder(tf.keras.layers.Layer):\n    def __init__(self, num_patches, projection_dim):\n        super(PatchEncoder, self).__init__()\n        self.num_patches = num_patches\n        self.projection_dim = projection_dim\n\n    def build(self, input_shape):\n        self.projection = tf.keras.layers.Dense(\n            self.projection_dim,\n            kernel_initializer=tf.keras.initializers.TruncatedNormal(stddev=0.02),\n            activation="linear",\n        )\n        self.positional_embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(\n            input_dim=self.num_patches,\n            output_dim=self.projection_dim,\n            embeddings_initializer=tf.keras.initializers.TruncatedNormal(\n                stddev=0.02\n            ),\n            trainable=False,\n        )\n\n    def call(self, inputs):\n        patch_embedd'}]

In this case, the class label is 1, which corresponds to the positive class.\n\nNote that the `transform` method of the transformer object returns a sparse matrix, which is a data structure that stores the non-zero elements of a matrix. In this case, the sparse matrix contains a single element, which corresponds to the rating of the review. The `predict` method of the Naive Bayes classifier object returns the class label for the transformed data.\n\nIn summary, the code above uses the transformer object `bow_transformer` to transform a list containing a single element, `rating_positive`, and then uses the `predict` method of a Naive Bayes classifier object `nb` to predict the class label for the transformed data. The output is an array containing the class label for the transformed data.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know'}]

The script imports the necessary libraries, reads a CSV file, and then creates two plots: a bar chart and a pie chart.\n\nThe bar chart is created using the `go.Bar` function, which takes the following arguments:\n\n* `x`: The values to be plotted on the x-axis. In this case, the values are the education levels (e.g. "Bachelor\'s degree", "Master\'s degree", etc.).\n* `y`: The values to be plotted on the y-axis.

In this case, the labels are the education levels (e.g. "Bachelor\'s degree", "Master\'s degree", etc.).\n* `values`: The values for each slice of the pie chart. In this case, the values are the counts of each education level.\n* `title`: The title of the pie chart. In this case, the title is "Education Level Distribution".\n* `hoverinfo`: The information to display when the user hovers over each slice of the pie chart. In this case, the information is the percentage of each education level.\n* `textinfo`: The information to display on each slice of the pie chart. In this case, the information is the percentage of each education level.\n* `textposition`: The position of the text on each slice of the pie chart. In this case, the text is displayed inside the slice.\n* `hole`: The hole in the center of the pie chart. In this case, the hole is 0.6, which means that 60% of the pie chart is empty.\n* `showlegend`: Whether to show the legend for the pie chart. In this case, the legend is shown.\n* `marker`: The marker style for the slices of the pie chart. In this case, the marker is a filled rectangle with a black outline.\n\nThe script then creates a figure object using the `go.Figure` function, which takes the data and layout as arguments.

The layer returns two outputs: `out`, which is the output of the attention layer, and `attn`, which is the attention weights.\n\nThe code first imports the necessary libraries, including TensorFlow and the Keras API. It then defines the MultiHeadAttention layer, which takes in the depth of the d-dimensional space used for positional encoding (`d_model`) and the number of heads to use in the multi-head-attention block (`num_heads`). The layer also defines the weights for the query, key, and value tensors using the `tf.keras.layers.Dense` layer.\n\nThe `split_heads` function is used to split the last dimension of the input tensors into `num_heads` and `depth`. The `call` function then computes the attention weights using the scaled dot-product attention mechanism.

Please wrap your code using ```.\n<</SYS>>\n\nThis code is a Python script that performs feature engineering on a dataset of movie reviews. The script first imports the necessary libraries, including NumPy, pandas, and the TextBlob library for text processing.\n\nThe script then reads in a CSV file containing movie review data and stores it in a pandas DataFrame called "df". The script then applies a sentiment analysis algorithm to the "reviewText" column of the DataFrame, using the TextBlob library to calculate the sentiment score for each review. The sentiment score is then used to create a new column in the DataFrame called "sentiment_label", which contains either "pos" or "neg" depending on the sentiment score.\n\nThe script then performs some data cleaning and preprocessing steps, including removing any rows with missing values and encoding the "sentiment_label" column using a LabelEncoder.\n\nThe script then uses the CountVectorizer class from scikit-learn to create a bag-of-words representation of the movie review text. The CountVectorizer class takes a corpus of text as input and returns a matrix of word frequencies. The script then uses the "analyzer" parameter to specify that the text should be analyzed using the word-level n-grams, and the "ngram_range" parameter to specify that the n-grams should be of length 2.\n\nThe script then applies the CountVectorizer to the "reviewText" column of the DataFrame, and stores the resulting matrix in a variable called "X_count". The script then prints the top 5 words with the highest frequency in the bag-of-words representation, using the "get_feature_names" method of the CountVectorizer object and the "toarray" method of the resulting matrix.\n\nOverall, this script demonstrates how to perform feature engineering on a dataset of movie reviews using Python and scikit-learn.[/INST] ```\n# Importing the necessary libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom textblob import TextBlob\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n\n# Reading the data\ndf = pd.read_csv("../input/movie-reviews-prior-to-2015/train.csv")\n\n# Applying sentiment analysis\ndf["sentiment_label"] = df["reviewText"].apply(lambda x: "pos" if TextBlob(x).sentiment.polarity > 0 else "neg")\n\n# Data cleaning and preprocessing\ndf = df.dropna()\ndf["sentiment_label"] = df["sentiment_label"].apply(lambda x: x.lower())\n\n# Creating a bag-of-words representation\nX_count = CountVectorizer(analyzer="word_ngrams", ngram_range=(2, 2)).fit_transform(\n    df["reviewText"]\n)\n\n# Printing the top 5 words with the highest frequency in the bag-of-words representation\nprint'}]

Calculate the covariance matrix of the DataFrame df_new:\n```\ncov_mat = np.cov(df_new.iloc[:, :-1].T)\n```\nThis line calculates the covariance matrix of the DataFrame df_new, excluding the last column. The `np.cov()` function calculates the covariance matrix of a set of vectors, and the `.iloc[:, :-1].T` syntax extracts the values of the DataFrame as a set of vectors.\n\n2. Extract the eigenvalues and eigenvectors:\n```\neig_vals, eig_vecs = np.linalg.eig(cov_mat)\n```\nThis line extracts the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. The `np.linalg.eig()` function calculates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix.\n\n3. Calculate the explained variance from the eigenvalues:\n```\ntot = sum(eig_vals)\nvar_exp = [\n    (i / tot) * 100 for i in sorted(eig_vals, reverse=True)\n]  # Individual explained variance\ncum_var_exp = np.cumsum(var_exp)  # Cumulative explained variance\n```\nThis line calculates the individual and cumulative explained variance from the eigenvalues. The `sum()` function calculates the sum of the eigenvalues, and the `sorted()` function sorts the eigenvalues in descending order. The `(i / tot) * 100` expression calculates the percentage of variance explained by each eigenvalue, and the `np.cumsum()` function calculates the cumulative sum of the percentages.\n\n4. Plot the explained variance:\n```\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))\nplt.bar(\n    range(len(var_exp)),\n    var_exp,\n    alpha=0.3333,\n    align="center",\n    label="individual explained variance",\n    color="g",\n)\nplt.step(\n    range(len(var_exp)), cum_var_exp, where="mid", label="cumulative explained variance"\n)\nplt.ylabel("Explained variance ratio")\nplt.xlabel("Principal components")\nplt.legend(loc="best")\nplt.show()\n```\nThis line plots the individual and cumulative explained variance. The `plt.bar()` function plots the individual explained variance as a bar chart, and the `plt.step()` function plots the cumulative explained variance as a step function. The `plt.ylabel()` and `plt.xlabel()` functions set the y-axis and x-axis labels, respectively. The `plt.legend()` function adds a legend to the plot, and the `plt.show()` function displays the plot.[/INST] ```\ncov_mat = np.cov(df_new.iloc[:, :-1].T)\neig_vals, eig_vecs = np.linalg.eig(cov_mat)\ntot = sum(eig_vals)\nvar_exp = [\n    (i / tot) * 100 for i in sorted(eig_vals, reverse=True)\n]  # Individual explained variance\ncum_var_exp = np.cumsum(var_exp)  # Cumulative explained variance\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))\nplt.bar(\n    range(len(var_exp)),\n    var_exp,\n    alpha=0.3333,\n    align="center",\n    label="individual explained variance",\n    color="g",\n)\nplt.step(\n    range(len(var_exp)), cum_var_exp, where="mid", label="cumulative explained variance"\n)\nplt.ylabel("Explained variance ratio")\nplt.xlabel("Principal components'}]

The chart should have two subplots, each showing the top 30 keywords with the highest frequency. The subplots should be arranged horizontally, with the first subplot showing the real disaster tweets and the second subplot showing the fake disaster tweets. The chart should have a title that says "Word Count Plots" and should be displayed in a 500x1000 window with a gray background. The chart should be rendered using the Kaggle renderer.\n\nTo do this, you will need to use the following libraries:\n\n* `matplotlib.pyplot` for creating the bar chart\n* `pandas` for working with dataframes\n* `collections` for creating a dictionary to store the frequency of keywords\n* `numpy` for working with arrays\n\nYou will also need to define the following functions:\n\n* `generate_ngrams`: a function that takes a string and an integer `n_gram` as input and returns a list of n-grams (sequences of `n_gram` words) in the string.\n* `horizontal_bar_chart`: a function that takes a dataframe and a color as input and returns a bar chart that shows the frequency of words in the dataframe.\n\nTo create the chart, you will need to do the following:\n\n1. Load the data into a dataframe using `pandas`.\n2. Create a dictionary to store the frequency of keywords using `collections.defaultdict`.\n3. Iterate over the tweets in the dataframe and count the frequency of each keyword using the `generate_ngrams` function.\n4.

The function then breaks the loop if the number of images in the grid has been reached.\n\nFinally, the function displays the plot.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the function:\n```\n# Load data and class names\ndata =...\nclass_names =...\n\n# Load model\nmodel =...\n\n# Define grid\nGRID = [5, 6]\n\n# Show images\nshow_images(data, class_names, model, GRID)\n```\nThis code will plot a grid of images with their corresponding labels and predictions, if a model is provided. The grid will have 5 rows and 6 columns.[/INST] ```\ndef show_images(data, class_names, model=None, GRID=[5, 6]):\n    # Plotiing Configuration\n    n_rows, n_cols = GRID\n    n_images = n_rows * n_cols\n    plt.figure(figsize=SIZE)\n\n    # iterate through the data\n    i = 1\n    for images, labels in iter(data):\n        # Select data at random\n        id = np.random.randint(len(images))\n        image, label = tf.expand_dims(images[id], axis=0), class_names[int(labels[id])]\n\n        # Make Prediciton\n        if model is not None:\n            prediction = model.predict(image)[0]\n            score = np.round(np.max(prediction), 2)\n            pred = class_names[np.argmax(prediction)]\n\n            title = "True : {}\\nPred : {}\\n Score : {:.2}".format(label, pred, score)\n\n        else:\n            title = label\n        cl'}]
