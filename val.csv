## 7.1. Comparing Scores

- Since we tracked several scores throughout our testing, let's first compare our scores. The table below is sorted by `Mutual_Info` score.
-  The first three scores `Mutual_Info, ARI, Homogeneity` are most commonly used for clustering. `Cross_Val, Train_Accuracy, Test_Accuracy` are limited to classification. Therefore the `NaN` missing values are the clustering algorithms.
- Notice that `Mutal_Info` scores and `Test_Accuracy` are very closely related to one another. 
    - `Homogeneity` is close as well, but it gives 0.99 for index 15, which is a clustering algorithm with several dozens of clusters. Homogeneity will reward clustering solutions with numerous `n_clusters` because it penalizes clusters containing mixed true_labels. But so many clusters are practically useless.","Write Python code to sort the values in the column ""Mutual_Info"" of a DataFrame performance in descending order, and then select the top 10 rows of the sorted DataFrame.

The main purpose of this project was to build a CNN model that would classify if subject has a tumor or not base on MRI scan. I used the [VGG-16](https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection) model architecture and weights to train the model for this binary problem. I used `accuracy` as a metric to justify the model performance which can be defined as:

$\textrm{Accuracy} = \frac{\textrm{Number of correclty predicted images}}{\textrm{Total number of tested images}} \times 100\%$

Final results look as follows:

| Set | Accuracy |
|:-:|:-:|
| Validation Set* | ~88% |
| Test Set* | ~80% |

\* *Note: there might be some misunderstanding in terms of set names so I want to describe what do I mean by `test` and `validation` set:*
* *`validation set` - is the set used during the model training to adjust the hyperparameters. *
* *`test set` - is the small set that I don't touch for the whole training process at all. It's been used for final model performance evaluation.*

## 1.1. Data Set Description

The image data that was used for this problem is [Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection). It conists of MRI scans of two classes:

* `NO` - no tumor, encoded as `0`
* `YES` - tumor, encoded as `1`

Unfortunately, the data set description doesn't hold any information where this MRI scans come from and so on.

## 1.2. What is Brain Tumor?

> A brain tumor occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: cancerous (malignant) tumors and benign tumors. Cancerous tumors can be divided into primary tumors, which start within the brain, and secondary tumors, which have spread from elsewhere, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the part of the brain involved. These symptoms may include headaches, seizures, problems with vision, vomiting and mental changes. The headache is classically worse in the morning and goes away with vomiting. Other symptoms may include difficulty walking, speaking or with sensations. As the disease progresses, unconsciousness may occur.

## Age Grouper

A function for categorizing the age values and setting dummy variables for each one.

Updated this one with the feedback from @Ayaan, replaced old custom grouping with pd.qcut This approach increased our score by 0.005'ish... Thanks for the feedback!

### [Back To Table of Contents](#toc_section)","Write Python code to define a function called age_binner that takes no arguments and returns a DataFrame with the following columns:

* 'AgeBin': a categorical variable representing the age group of each row, with the following categories:
	+ 'less2': ages less than 2
	+ '2-18': ages between 2 and 18
	+ '18-35': ages between 18 and 35
	+ '35-65': ages between 35 and 65
	+ '65plus': ages 65 or older
* 'AgeBin_less2': a binary variable indicating whether the age is less than 2
* 'AgeBin_2-18': a binary variable indicating whether the age is between 2 and 18
* 'AgeBin_18-35': a binary variable indicating whether the age is between 18 and 35
* 'AgeBin_35-65': a binary variable indicating whether the age is between 35 and 65
* 'AgeBin_65plus': a binary variable indicating whether the age is 65 or older

The function should perform the following operations:

1. Import the pandas library as pd.
2. Import the numpy library as np.
3. Define a global variable called combined that is a DataFrame.
4. Define a list called bins that contains the following values: [0, 2, 18, 35, 65, np.inf].
5. Define a list called names that contains the following values: [""less2"", ""2-18"", ""18-35"", ""35-65"", ""65plus""].
6. Use the pd.cut() function to create a new column called 'AgeBin' in the combined DataFrame, with the values in the 'Age' column grouped into the corresponding age groups based on the bins list.
7. Use the pd.qcut() function to create a new column called 'AgeBin' in the combined DataFrame, with the values in the 'Age' column grouped into the corresponding age groups based on the q parameter.
8. Use the pd.get_dummies() function to create a new DataFrame called age_dummies, with binary variables indicating the presence or absence of each age group in the 'AgeBin' column.
9. Use the pd.concat() function to concatenate the combined DataFrame and the age_dummies DataFrame along the rows, and assign the result to the combined variable.
10. Use the drop() function to remove the 'AgeBin' column from the combined DataFrame, and assign the result to the combined variable.
11. Use the drop() function to remove the 'Age' column from the combined DataFrame, and assign the result to the combined variable.
12. Use the status() function to print a message indicating that the age bins have been created.
13. Return the combined DataFrame.","def age_binner():

2015,2158,1,"# IntroductionHello from my new project. In this project, I tried to detect masked people and unmasked people using the yolov7 library. Steps of this project, Firstly I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle, and I will share with you the link of the dataset in this chapter. Then I visualized images of the dataset and reviewed XML format folders. Images tagged in xml format are not compatible for yolov7 so I converted xml files to txt format and saved the txt files in a file. And then I created a new dataset for yolov7 using text file and image files. I split the txt folder and the image folder into train, test and Val folders, as yolov7 wanted and I specified ways of these folders to yolov7 with ""data.yaml"". After I created to new dataset, I downloaded the yolov7 library and installed it. After I installed the yolov7 library I made to train with new dataset and I visualized the results. After the training, I detected masked and unmasked people in a picture I downloaded. I am currently on the way of improving myself. In this learning path, I would be very happy if you would examine my project and help me with how to improve my project or what I should do in this development path. I wish you a good day and good work.

6720,355,8,"**The Isolation Forest algorithm for noise detecting**

#### Scientific Basis:
The Isolation Forest algorithm creates numerous random trees and uses the length of the paths in these trees to isolate anomalies. Shorter paths usually indicate anomalies. The ensemble approach averages over multiple trees for robustness (""Isolation Forest"", Liu et al., 2008).

**NOTE:**
In the case of Isolation Forest, scaling is generally not necessary. Here's why:

### Scientific Reasons:

1. **Decision Trees**: Isolation Forest uses decision trees under the hood. Decision trees partition the data based on the value of features but are not sensitive to the scale of the feature. 

2. **Path Length**: The algorithm relies on the path length in the tree to make a decision about the anomaly score. This path length is a relative measure and does not depend on the scale of the feature.

3. **Invariance to Monotonic Transformations**: Isolation Forest is invariant to monotonic transformations of the features. Scaling is a linear transformation, which is a special case of monotonic transformations.

### Practical Consideration:

1. **Interpretability**: If your features have vastly different scales, and you plan to visualize them or interpret the features' importance, then scaling might be useful for those secondary tasks, but not for the functioning of the Isolation Forest itself.","Write Python code to perform the following tasks:

# Introduction #

Now that you've learned the fundamentals of convolutional classifiers, you're ready to move on to more advanced topics.

In this lesson, you'll learn a trick that can give a boost to your image classifiers: it's called **data augmentation**. # The Usefulness of Fake Data #

The best way to improve the performance of a machine learning model is to train it on more data. The more examples the model has to learn from, the better it will be able to recognize which differences in images matter and which do not. More data helps the model to *generalize* better.

One easy way of getting more data is to use the data you already have. If we can transform the images in our dataset in ways that preserve the class, we can teach our classifier to ignore those kinds of transformations. For instance, whether a car is facing left or right in a photo doesn't change the fact that it is a *Car* and not a *Truck*. So, if we **augment** our training data with flipped images, our classifier will learn that ""left or right"" is a difference it should ignore.

And that's the whole idea behind data augmentation: add in some extra fake data that looks reasonably like the real data and your classifier will improve.

# Using Data Augmentation #

Typically, many kinds of transformation are used when augmenting a dataset. These might include rotating the image, adjusting the color or contrast, warping the image, or many other things, usually applied in combination. Here is a sample of the different ways a single image might be transformed.





Data augmentation is usually done *online*, meaning, as the images are being fed into the network for training. Recall that training is usually done on mini-batches of data. This is what a batch of 16 images might look like when data augmentation is used.





Each time an image is used during training, a new random transformation is applied. This way, the model is always seeing something a little different than what it's seen before. This extra variance in the training data is what helps the model on new data.

It's important to remember though that not every transformation will be useful on a given problem. Most importantly, whatever transformations you use should not mix up the classes. If you were training a [digit recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer), for instance, rotating images would mix up '9's and '6's. In the end, the best approach for finding good augmentations is the same as with most ML problems: try it and see!

# Example - Training with Data Augmentation #

Keras lets you augment your data in two ways. The first way is to include it in the data pipeline with a function like [`ImageDataGenerator`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image/ImageDataGenerator). The second way is to include it in the model definition by using Keras's **preprocessing layers**. This is the approach that we'll take. The primary advantage for us is that the image transformations will be computed on the GPU instead of the CPU, potentially speeding up training.

In this exercise, we'll learn how to improve the classifier from Lesson 1 through data augmentation. This next hidden cell sets up the data pipeline.","Write Python code to import the necessary libraries, set the random seed for reproducibility, set Matplotlib defaults, load the training and validation sets using the `image_dataset_from_directory` function, and define the data pipeline using the `map` and `cache` functions.","# Imports

The code defines a function called `load_split_train_test` that takes two arguments: `datadir`, which is the directory where the dataset is located, and `valid_size`, which is the proportion of the dataset that should be used for validation.

The function first imports the necessary libraries, including `torch`, `torchvision`, and `numpy`. It then defines a `data_transforms` dictionary that contains the transformations to be applied to the images.

The function then defines a `train_data` and `test_data` variable that are used to load the training and validation data from the `datadir` directory. The `train_data` variable is a `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder` object that contains the training images and their corresponding labels.

The code then calls the `load_split_train_test` function with the `DATA_PATH` directory and a `valid_size` of 0.2, and assigns the returned values to the `trainloader`, `valloader`, and `dataset_size` variables.

#### Task Details

- What has been published concerning ethical considerations for research? What has been published concerning social sciences at the outbreak response?

- Specifically, we want to know what the literature reports about:

    - Efforts to articulate and translate existing ethical principles and standards to salient issues in COVID-2019
    - Efforts to embed ethics across all thematic areas, engage with novel ethical issues that arise and coordinate to minimize duplication of oversight
    - Efforts to support sustained education, access, and capacity building in the area of ethics
    - Efforts to establish a team at WHO that will be integrated within multidisciplinary research and operational platforms and that will connect with existing and expanded global networks of social sciences.
    - Efforts to develop qualitative assessment frameworks to systematically collect information related to local barriers and enablers for the uptake and adherence to public health measures for prevention and control. This includes the rapid identification of the secondary impacts of these measures. (e.g. use of surgical masks, modification of health seeking behaviors for SRH, school closures)
    - Efforts to identify how the burden of responding to the outbreak and implementing public health measures affects the physical and psychological health of those providing care for Covid-19 patients and identify the immediate needs that must be addressed.
    - Efforts to identify the underlying drivers of fear, anxiety and stigma that fuel misinformation and rumor, particularly through social media.### Task 9.1: ***Efforts to articulate and translate existing ethical principles and standards to salient issues in COVID-2019***","Write Python code to import the NLTK library, and use the WordNetLemmatizer to lemmatize the words in a list of keywords.

2738,2705,2,"### Q3) What is an fMRI scan and how does it work??

An fMRI scan is a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan that measures and maps the brain’s activity. An fMRI scan uses the same technology as an MRI scan. An MRI is a noninvasive test that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create an image of the brain. The image an MRI scan produces is just of organs/tissue, but an fMRI will produce an image showing the blood flow in the brain. By showing the blood flow it will display which parts of the brain are being stimulated.

### Q4) How Features Were Obtained (FMRI image Data Collection)?

An unbiased strategy was utilized to obtain the provided features. This means that a separate, unrelated large imaging dataset was utilized to learn feature templates. Then, these templates were ""projected"" onto the original imaging data of each subject used for this competition using spatially constrained independent component analysis (scICA) via group information guided ICA (GIG-ICA).

The first set of features are source-based morphometry (SBM) loadings. These are subject-level weights from a group-level ICA decomposition of gray matter concentration maps from structural MRI (sMRI) scans.

The second set are static functional network connectivity (FNC) matrices. These are the subject-level cross-correlation values among 53 component timecourses estimated from GIG-ICA of resting state functional MRI (fMRI).

The third set of features are the component spatial maps (SM). These are the subject-level 3D images of 53 spatial networks estimated from GIG-ICA of resting state functional MRI (fMRI).","Write Python code to embed a YouTube video with the ID ""3fNf8KX1AlQ"" into a web page, with a width of 600 pixels and a height of 400 pixels.","YouTubeVideo(""3fNf8KX1AlQ"", width=600, height=400)

1. Import the necessary libraries: `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`, `import numpy as np`, `from PIL import Image`, `import skimage as sk`, `from skimage import io as sk_io`, `import cv2`, `import pandas as pd`.
2. Set up a figure of an appropriate size: `fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 12))`.
3. Loop through the subfolders in the specified folder: `for root, folders, filenames in os.walk(src_folder):`.
4. Keep an incrementing count of each image: `image_num = 0`.
5. Find the first image file in the folder: `file_name = os.listdir(os.path.join(root, folder))[0]`.
6. Get the full path from the root folder: `file_path = os.path.join(root, folder, file_name)`.
7. Open the file using the matplotlib.image library: `image = mp_image.imread(file_path)`.
8. Add the image to the figure: `a = fig.add_subplot(num_folders, 1, image_num)`.
9. Add the image to the plot: `image_plot = plt.imshow(image)`.
10. Add a caption with the folder name: `a.set_title(folder)`.
11. Show the plot: `plt.show()`.
12. Load the image using Pillow and add it to the images array: `pil_image = Image.open(src_folder + ""unicorns/unicorn_20001.jpg"")`.
13. Load the image using scikit-learn and add it to the images array: `sk_image = sk.io.imread(src_folder + ""unicorns/unicorn_20001.jpg"")`.
14. Load the image using OpenCV and add it to the images array: `cv_image = cv2.imread(""crypto-unicorns-nft/unicorns/unicorn_20001.jpg"")`.

Gradient Boosting Classifier seems effected by high variance, we might try to fix it by hyperparameter tuning but I'd say we already have good number of decent estimators so we can continue with them.

- While having highest portion of the passengers on the ship, 3rd class also having highest casuality ratio. Meanwhile first class have more survival rate. So this kinda confirms our hypothesis that mustering orders from captain (1>2>3) might have effect on survival.
- Again most of the passengers on the ship are males(around two third of the passengers) they also have much higher ratio of casualities too. This confirms women part of the ""Women and children first policy"" had an effect in our Titanic case.
- Most of our passengers are travelling alone, they also have high casuality rate. So being married or with family has some positive effect on survival?
- Most of the passenger are embarked from Southampton. Survival rates differ between ports but I'm not sure if it's important observation or just random. We can relate this to families, groups to get something out of it or just use as it is.

The state of the art results reported in the paper are achieved by pre-training the ViT model using the JFT-300M dataset, then fine-tuning it on the target dataset. To improve the model quality without pre-training, you can try to train the model for more epochs, use a larger number of Transformer layers, resize the input images, change the patch size, or increase the projection dimensions. Besides, as mentioned in the paper, the quality of the model is affected not only by architecture choices, but also by parameters such as the learning rate schedule, optimizer, weight decay, etc. In practice, it's recommended to fine-tune a ViT model that was pre-trained using a large, high-resolution dataset.## ViT model Evaluation","Write Python code to create a figure with a size of 20x10, and plot two subplots.

# 6 | Performance Evaluation

  

Now that the model has trained on the data we need to inspect how well it performs on the unseen test data. In order to conduct this inspection we need to evaluate the performance of the model on the test data and record evaluation metrics. Since this is a categorical classification problem we'll make use of some well known classification metrics. Hence, we'll make use of the Scikit Learn library to inspect the model. We'll also use the following to inspect the model:

> - [Classification Report](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html#sklearn.metrics.classification_report)
> - [Accuracy Score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html#sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score)

    - Takes the dictionary of the corpus where words are represented as integers
    - Uses dictionary to change corpus word tokens with dictionary integer tokens","Write Python code to define a function called `integer_representations` that takes two arguments: `vocab_dict` and `token_list`. The function should return a list of integers, where each integer represents the index of the corresponding token in the `vocab_dict`. If a token is not found in the `vocab_dict`, the function should return a value of 999999999.

The `vocab_dict` is a dictionary that maps each token to its index in the list of tokens. The `token_list` is a list of tokens that need to be converted to integers.

The function should iterate through the `token_list` and check if each token is present in the `vocab_dict`. If the token is present, the function should return the index of the token in the `vocab_dict`. If the token is not present, the function should return a value of 999999999.

The function should also handle the case where the `vocab_dict` is empty or the `token_list` is empty. In such cases, the function should return an empty list.

Here is an example of how the function can be used:
```
vocab_dict = {'hello': 0, 'world': 1, 'python': 2}
token_list = ['hello', 'world', 'python', 'java']

integer_representations(vocab_dict, token_list)
# Output: [0, 1, 2, 999999999]
```
In this example, the `vocab_dict` contains three tokens: 'hello', 'world', and 'python'. The `token_list` contains four tokens: 'hello', 'world', 'python', and 'java'. The function should return a list of integers where each integer represents the index of the corresponding token in the `vocab_dict`. The output should be `[0, 1, 2, 999999999]`.","# word tag list

You are an expert in Data Science. Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write Python code that appropriately completes the request. Please wrap your code using ```.
<</SYS>>

Write Python code to define a function called `integer_representations` that takes two arguments: `vocab_dict` and `token_list`. The function should return a list of integers, where each integer represents the index of the corresponding token in the `vocab_dict`. If a token is not found in the `vocab_dict`, the function should return a value of 999999999.

The `vocab_dict` is a dictionary that maps each token to its index in the list of tokens. The `token_list` is a list of tokens that need to be converted to integers.

The function should iterate through the `token_list` and check if each token is present in the `vocab_dict`. If the token is present, the function should return the index of the token in the `vocab_dict`. If the token is not present, the function should return a value of 999999999.

The function should also handle the case where the `vocab_dict` is empty or the `token_list` is empty. In such cases, the function should return an empty list.

Here is an example of how the function can be used:
```
vocab_dict = {'hello': 0, 'world': 1, 'python': 2}
token_list = ['hello', 'world', 'python', 'java']

integer_representations(vocab_dict, token_list)
# Output: [0, 1, 2, 999999999]
```
In this example, the `vocab_dict` contains three tokens: 'hello', 'world', and 'python'. The `token_list` contains four tokens: 'hello', 'world', 'python', and 'java'. The function should return a list of integers where each integer represents the index of the corresponding token in the `vocab_dict`. The output should be `[0, 1, 2, 999999999]`.[/INST] ```

","To complete the code, you need to implement the three functions `functionA`, `functionB`, and `functionC`.

Here are the instructions for each function:

1. `functionA`: This function takes in two 2D tensors `A` and `B` and returns the column sum of `A` multiplied by the sum of all the elements of `B`, i.e., a scalar.
2. `functionB`: This function takes in a square matrix `C` and returns a 2D tensor consisting of a flattened `C` with the index of each element appended to this tensor in the row dimension.
3. `functionC`: This function takes in two 2D tensors `D` and `E`. If the dimensions allow it, this function returns the elementwise sum of `D`-shaped `E`, and `D`; else this function returns a 1D tensor that is the concatenation of the two tensors.

To complete the code, you need to implement these functions using the PyTorch library. You can use the `torch.tensor` function to create tensors, and the `torch.sum` function to calculate the sum of elements in a tensor. You can also use the `torch.cat` function to concatenate tensors.

You are an expert in Data Science. Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write Python code that appropriately completes the request. Please wrap your code using ```.
<</SYS>>

To complete the code, you need to implement the three functions `functionA`, `functionB`, and `functionC`.

Here are the instructions for each function:

1. `functionA`: This function takes in two 2D tensors `A` and `B` and returns the column sum of `A` multiplied by the sum of all the elements of `B`, i.e., a scalar.
2. `functionB`: This function takes in a square matrix `C` and returns a 2D tensor consisting of a flattened `C` with the index of each element appended to this tensor in the row dimension.
3. `functionC`: This function takes in two 2D tensors `D` and `E`. If the dimensions allow it, this function returns the elementwise sum of `D`-shaped `E`, and `D`; else this function returns a 1D tensor that is the concatenation of the two tensors.

To complete the code, you need to implement these functions using the PyTorch library. You can use the `torch.tensor` function to create tensors, and the `torch.sum` function to calculate the sum of elements in a tensor. You can also use the `torch.cat` function to concatenate tensors.

Once you have implemented the functions, you can uncomment the lines that call the functions and print the results.[/INST] ```

5900,2000,11,"## Building the ViT

The ViT model consists of multiple Transformer blocks, which use the layers.MultiHeadAttention layer as a self-attention mechanism applied to the sequence of patches. The Transformer blocks produce a [batch_size, num_patches, projection_dim] tensor, which is processed via an classifier head with softmax to produce the final class probabilities output.

Unlike the technique described in the paper, which prepends a learnable embedding to the sequence of encoded patches to serve as the image representation, all the outputs of the final Transformer block are reshaped with layers.Flatten() and used as the image representation input to the classifier head. Note that the layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D layer could also be used instead to aggregate the outputs of the Transformer block, especially when the number of patches and the projection dimensions are large.","Write Python code to create a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier model using the Keras API. The model should take an input image of size (240, 240, 3) and output a probability distribution over 2 classes. The model should use the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and a weight decay of 0.01. The model should also use a SparseCategoricalCrossentropy loss function with from_logits=True. The model should also use a SparseCategoricalAccuracy and SparseTopKCategoricalAccuracy metrics. The model should be trained on the training data for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32 and validation data of (x_test, y_test).

4. Create a function called ""concat_df"" that takes two DataFrames as input and returns a concatenated DataFrame of the two DataFrames on axis 0.
5. Create a list of features called ""features"" that contains the names of the columns in the training data that you want to analyze.
6. Use a for loop to iterate over the features in the ""features"" list and print the number of missing values in each feature for the combined dataset, the train dataset, and the test dataset.
7. Use the Tokenizer class from TensorFlow to tokenize the text data and create a vocabulary of 10,000 words.
8. Create a sequence of tokenized words for the training and test data and pad them to a maximum length of 120 words.

*1. If one uncommon word is used in that text, this world has a higher probability to indicate the school that uses it. (For example, if there is  the word ""Geist,"" it has a higher likelihood to show our school is ""german idealism."")*


*2. If one uncommon word is used very frequently, it has a higher chance of indicating our subject and school. (For instance, in communism, we will see the word ""bourgeoisie"" a lot.)*

AUTONOMY & LIBERTY 

PROMOTING PUBLIC HEALTH: UTILITARISM  (Actions are right to the extent that they produce the best consequences for the greatest number of people.)

THE HARM PRINCIPLE: Protecting the Most Vulnerable

In John Stuart Mill’s essay “On Liberty” (Mill 1869), Mill defends what has come to be called the Harm Principle. The Harm Principle says that the only justification for interfering with the liberty of an individual, against her will, is to prevent harm to others.

Some of the most vulnerable population are newborns, people who are immuno-compromised from diseases such as cancer, and the elderly are highly susceptible to diseases.  When more parents choose not to vaccinate their healthy children, those most vulnerable have
a much greater chance of becoming ill, since it creates more incubators where infectious disease can live. When all or most people in the same geographic area are vaccinated, infectious diseases have no bodies in which to grow. So, it is supposed, it is  impossible to have an outbreak of disease. As the number of unvaccinated people rises due to vaccine refusal, it creates more places for disease to live (inside more bodies).

We can see that average smoothing is not as effective as Wavelet denoising at finding macroscopic trends and pattersns in the data. A lot of the noise in the original sales persists even after denoising. Therefore, wavelet denoising is clearly more effective at finding trends in the sales data.

        2) Find a general cycle of spreading the virus in a country
    2. Information gathering
        1) Gathered
            - cases, search trends, floating population (Seoul), weather, policies
        2) Need to gather (S.Korea)
            - incoming visitors from abroad
        3) Need to gather (other countries)
            - cases, policies, search trends
        4) Need to gather (all)
            - infection / reproduction rate, incubation period, ariline usage, travel trend, oil price
            - data on other endemics by coronavirus, data on other infectious diseases
    3. Preliminary (exploratory) analysis
        1) Possible features found by EDA
            - strong: search trends (APPLIED)
                - turned out to be useful for linear regression
            - mild: floating population
            - weak: weather (temperature, max_wind_speed)
        2) Possible strategies for selecting features
            - feature importances (with decision trees)
            - correlation matrix
            - dimensionality reduction (with PCA)
    4. Choosing and fitting models
        1) Linear regression (APPLIED)
            - more feature engineering needed
            - how to predict future confirmed cases only with past search trends
                - apply forecasting method on predictions by a linear regression to stretch them out
        2) Models from the textbook ""Forecasting: Principles and Practice""
            - ARIMA: AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (APPLIED)
                - turned out not to work well with a simple parameter selection
        3) Facebook Prophet (APPLIED)
            - catches the global shape and seasonality with a proper season size
            - can learn more general shape with more data of repeating cycle (than with 1 single country) 
        4) Neural network (especially RNN, LSTM)
    5. Using and evaluating forecasting models
        1) Train / test on the data of S.Korea (APPLIED)
        2) Train / test on the data of similar groups as S.Korea in terms of spreading phase (APPLIED - Germany)
        3) Train / test on all countries (partly APPLIED with those with <0.1 recent_to_max ratio)
        4) Choose (or ensemble) the best models
        5) Refine (with (hyper)parameter tuning)
        6) Deploy (with keeping debugging)

    5. Version 106: Original datasets on EDA updated
        1) Activity dataset is discarded
        2) A column for underlying disease of a patient is discarded in the patient dataset
        3) A typo in a name of regions appears again in the weather dataset
        4) Most datasets are updated with the values up to the late of June 2020 (of May for Seoul floating) 
# [[Developing Directions]](#table)
    1. Make recent_to_max more robust to the countries with recent fluctuations
        1) Is 1000 minimum cumulative cases enough to filter out the countries with unstable daily cases?
            - no > increased to 2000 (APPLIED) > increased to 3000 (2020-06-12)
            - with a bigger threshold, the number of countries with <0.1 ratio would be too small to make a long time series
        2) Isn't 1 recent window too vulnerable to daily fluctuations?
            - yes > changed to 3 (APPLIED)
            - a longer than 7 window works bad at differentiating the countries with high ratios
        3) What about avg_max than max?
            a. (max + second_max + third_max) / 3 (APPLIED)
            b. (1day_before_max + max + 1day_after_max) / 3
                - discarded because there are countries with fluctuations around the peak
    2. How can we use our model for the countries which haven't reached the peak of infections yet?
    3. Get more features for LR / Consider non-linear regressions too### Postscript

2. Load the training and test data into DataFrames.
3. Convert the text data into TF-IDF features using the TF-IDF transformer from scikit-learn.

Write Python code to perform grid search for the best value of the alpha parameter for the Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) classifier using the TF-IDF features.

The code should perform the following steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries, including NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
2. Load the training and test data into DataFrames.
3. Convert the text data into TF-IDF features using the TF-IDF transformer from scikit-learn.
4. Split the data into training and test sets.
5. Define a grid search object with the TF-IDF features and the target variable as the input.
6. Perform grid search with the specified parameters and evaluate the performance using the F1 score.
7. Print the results of the grid search, including the best value of the alpha parameter and the corresponding F1 score.

The resulting DataFrame should contain the following columns:

* param_alpha: The value of the alpha parameter used in the grid search.
* mean_test_score: The mean F1 score of the grid search for the corresponding value of alpha.[/INST] ```

Another useful feature when loading a dataset is applying transformations on the data - color conversions, normalization, cropping, rotation etc. There are many predefined transformations in the `torchvision.transforms` package and you can also combine them using the `Compose` transform. Checkout the [pytorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html) for details.### Coding Exercise 2.6: Load the CIFAR10 dataset as grayscale images

```
image, label = data[random.randint(0, len(data))]

* Crazy, that we observe cases with -1000 and -2000. What does that mean? We need to find it out!
* Nonetheless the mode is located at 0 for all example raw pixel value arrays. This is likely to correspond to air. Consequently our raw pixel values are not given as HU units. 
* But we can transform the image to HU units by scaling with the slope and intercept.
* Then we can see that mode is located at -1000 (HU of air).

<</SYS>>

Write Python code to create a function called `create_data_batches` that takes in the following arguments:

* `X`: a list of filepaths to images
* `y`: a list of labels for the images (optional)
* `batch_size`: the size of the batches to create
* `valid_data`: a boolean indicating whether the data is validation data or not
* `test_data`: a boolean indicating whether the data is test data or not

The function should return a `tf.data.Dataset` object that contains the data batches.

The function should first check if the data is test data, and if so, it should create a `tf.data.Dataset` object from the filepaths in `X` and return it.

If the data is not test data, it should check if it is validation data, and if so, it should create a `tf.data.Dataset` object from the filepaths in `X` and the labels in `y` and return it.

If the data is not validation data, it should shuffle the filepaths and labels before mapping the `get_image_label` function to create the (image, label) tuples. It should then turn the training data into batches and return it.

The function should also check the different attributes of the data batches and print them.

The code should be written in a way that is easy to read and understand, and should include comments to explain what each line of code does.[/INST] ```

The script imports several libraries, including NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib. It also defines several functions, including `get_row_data`, `get_unlabeled_df`, `split_unlabeled`, `get_sci_ents`, `get_gen_ents`, and `get_train_data`.

The script first defines a list of paths to unlabeled articles, and then selects 15 of them at random. It then uses the `get_unlabeled_df` function to read the selected articles into a pandas DataFrame, and performs some preprocessing steps on the DataFrame.

Next, the script defines a list of paths to labeled articles, and uses the `get_train_data` function to read the labeled articles into a pandas DataFrame. The `get_train_data` function returns a tuple of two lists, where the first list contains the labeled paragraphs and the second list contains the corresponding labels (1 for positive and 0 for negative).

The script then converts the labels to a numpy array and saves it to a file. Finally, it prints some information about the number of paragraphs in the labeled and unlabeled datasets.

Write Python code to create a function called `plot_heatmap` that takes in three arguments: `df`, `col1`, and `col2`. The function should plot a heatmap of the correlation between the two columns using the `sns.heatmap` function from the `seaborn` library. The heatmap should have a random colormap chosen from the list of available colormaps in `matplotlib`. The function should also add annotations to the heatmap and format the values to one decimal place.

The function should also create a function called `plot_heatmap_percentage` that takes in the same three arguments as `plot_heatmap`. The function should plot a heatmap of the correlation between the two columns using the `sns.heatmap` function from the `seaborn` library. The heatmap should have a random colormap chosen from the list of available colormaps in `matplotlib`. The function should also add annotations to the heatmap and format the values to two decimal places.

The function should also create a function called `plot_stackbar` that takes in the same three arguments as `plot_heatmap`. The function should plot a stacked bar chart of the correlation between the two columns using the `pd.crosstab` function from the `pandas` library. The stacked bar chart should have a random colormap chosen from the list of available colormaps in `matplotlib`. The function should also add a legend to the chart and format the values to one decimal place.[/INST] ```

<</SYS>>

Write Python code to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on a dataset with a binary classification task, using the Keras library in TensorFlow. The code should perform the following tasks:

1. Import the necessary libraries, including TensorFlow, Keras, and the pandas library for data manipulation.
2. Load the dataset and split it into training, validation, and test sets.
3. Preprocess the data by standardizing the features and converting the target variable to a binary classification problem.
4. Define the CNN model architecture, including the number of filters, kernel size, and activation functions.
5. Compile the model with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.
6. Train the model on the training set for 10 epochs, with early stopping and model checkpointing to avoid overfitting.
7. Evaluate the model on the validation set and print the evaluation metrics.
8. Use the best model to make predictions on the test set and print the accuracy.
9. Use the best model to make predictions on the test set and print the accuracy.
10. Empty the GPU cache and garbage collect the memory to avoid memory leaks.

The code should be written in a modular and reusable way, with functions for data preprocessing, model definition, and evaluation. The code should also include comments to explain the purpose of each section and the reasoning behind the choices made.[/INST] ```

* `all_img_data`: a list of image data, where each element is a dictionary containing the filepath, width, height, and list of bounding boxes.
* `C`: a configuration object.
* `img_length_calc_function`: a function that calculates the final layer's feature map size according to the input image size.
* `mode`: a string that specifies whether the function is being called in ""train"" or ""test"" mode.

The function should perform the following steps:

1. Read in the image data, and optionally add augmentation if `mode` is ""train"".
2. Resize the image so that the smallest side is 300 pixels.
3. Calculate the ground-truth anchors using the `calc_rpn` function.
4. Zero-center the image by subtracting the mean pixel value, and preprocess the image by dividing by the scaling factor.
5. Transpose the image and ground-truth anchors to the appropriate format.
6. Return the preprocessed image, ground-truth anchors, augmented image data, debug image, and number of positive anchors.

8033,3663,8,"# **Creating the Model**

### **EfficientNet: An Overview**

**EfficientNet** represents a family of [Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) architectures designed with the primary objective of creating a balance between the computational cost and model performance for image recognition tasks. This balance was achieved by systematically scaling up the depth, width, and resolution of the model.

The foundation of EfficientNet is a baseline network called **EfficientNet-B0**, which was developed by applying a conventional compound scaling method. However, to scale up this baseline network, a novel scaling method was introduced which uses a compound coefficient to scale up the depth, width, and resolution of the network simultaneously, instead of doing it arbitrarily.

### **EfficientNet Variants**

Within the EfficientNet family, there are a variety of models, each denoted by a different letter and number, such as ""B3"" in EfficientNet-B3, ""B4"" in EfficientNet-B4, and so on. These models have different scaling coefficients, which ultimately determine the model's size and capacity.

### **EfficientNet-B4**

**EfficientNet-B4** is one of the EfficientNet models that has been scaled up from the baseline EfficientNet-B0 using a compound coefficient. It is larger and more powerful compared to its smaller counterparts (for instance, EfficientNet-B3 or EfficientNet-B2) but smaller than the larger variants (like EfficientNet-B5 or EfficientNet-B6).

One of the key advantages of EfficientNet-B4 is that it offers a balance between model size, computational cost, and accuracy. This balance makes EfficientNet-B4 suitable for a variety of image classification tasks where both efficiency and performance are crucial. This model has demonstrated excellent performance in both low- and high-resource settings, showcasing its flexibility and capability across different data regimes.### **Load Data**

This code is designed to handle the initial data processing and setup required for a machine learning model using TensorFlow/Keras.

- `data_dir`: Specifies the path to the directory containing the data.

- `try-except` block: Captures and handles exceptions during data processing and model setup.

    - **Inside the `try` block**:
    
        - `train_df, valid_df, test_df = create_df(data_dir)`: Calls the `create_df` function using the specified data directory, which returns DataFrames for the training, validation, and testing sets.
        
        - `batch_size = 40`: Sets the batch size for the data generators to 40.
        
        - `train_gen, valid_gen, test_gen = create_model_data(train_df, valid_df, test_df, batch_size)`: Calls the `create_model_data` function using the created DataFrames and batch size, which returns generators for the training, validation, and testing sets.

    - **Inside the `except` block**:
    
        - `print('Invalid input')`: Prints an error message if an exception is encountered during the data processing or model setup stages.","Write Python code to import the necessary libraries and define the data directory, then try to create the dataframes, generators, and batch size.

* Above   0.06 –– Largest
Bounding Box Area - Quartile Range
* Under     0.0075 –– Smallest
* 0.0075 to 0.0125 –– Small
* 0.0125 to 0.0250 –– Medium
* 0.0250 to 0.0500 –– Large
* Above     0.0500 –– Largest

5396,1660,1,"Hello Fellow Kagglers,

This competition has been challenging to say the least, especially the submission.

After a few weeks I finally got a working training + inference pipeline which is shared through this notebook.

The model consists of a transformer embedding + encoder + decoder.

Inference is performed by starting with an SOS token and predicting one character at a time using the previous prediction.

Feel free to ask for clarafications or comment.

Notebook will be updated periodically.

[Preprocessing Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markwijkhuizen/aslfr-eda-preprocessing-dataset)

**V6**

This competition has an inference limit of 5 hours which requires careful allocation of computational resources in the model. Most changes are based on the assymetrical number of encoder/deocder calls during inference.

Inference requires the encoder to encode the input frames and subsequently use that encoding to predict the 1st character by inputting the encoding and SOS (Start of Sentence) token. Next, the encoding, SOS token and 1st predicted token are used to predict the 2nd character. Inference thus requires 1 call to the encoder and multiple calls to the encoder. On average a phrase is 18 characters long, requiring 18+1(SOS token) calls to the decoder. To stay within the 5 hour inference limit the encoder can be computationally heavy, however the decoder should be light.

Some inspiration is taken from the [1st place solution - training](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hoyso48/1st-place-solution-training) from the last [Google - Isolated Sign Language Recognition
](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/asl-signs) competition.

* Increased training epochs 30 -> 100
* Using all data for training, no validation set
* Increased number of decoder blocks 2 -> 3
* Increased encoder dimensions 256 -> 384
* Halved attention dimension to decrease computational intensity of Multi Head Attention
* Added 20% dropout to multi head attention output
* Batch size 128 -> 64
* Classification layer linear activation for logits in loss function

**V7**

A small update, since several other notebooks got released with a LB score as high as 0.689!

This will most likely be the last version of this notebook, it seems like the way to get to 0.70 is CTC loss.

The 5 hour inference limit could is limitation with this encoder/decoder architecture.

Performance could be improved by using [FlashAttention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.08691v1.pdf), however this is not yet implemented in Tensorflow.

Another observation is the huge speedup from `jit_compile`, which allows for inferencing up to ~30 samples per second. The TFLite model obtains about ~3 samples/s and it seems the `jit_compile` flag does not impact the TFLite model speed.

I am happily surprised with the interaction this notebook caused and I want to thank you all for the nice comments :)

Modifications in this version

* More efficient transformer architecture based on [1st place solution - training
](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hoyso48/1st-place-solution-training) by [HOYSO48 ](https://www.kaggle.com/hoyso48)
* NUM_BLOCKS_ENCODER = 3 → 4
* Correct attention mask in decoder: causal → non empty frames

Write Python code to perform k-means clustering on the data in the DataFrame df using the KMeans algorithm from scikit-learn, and assign the cluster labels to a new column named ""Label"". Then, use the seaborn library to create a scatter plot of the data, with the x-axis and y-axis representing the values in the columns ""x"" and ""y"", respectively. The plot should have two different colors for the two clusters, and the size of the points should be adjusted to represent the alpha parameter.[/INST] ```
model = KMeans(n_clusters=2)
df[""Label""] = model.fit_predict(X_emb)

palette = sns.color_palette(n_colors=2)
sns.scatterplot(
    ""x"", ""y"", data=df, edgecolor=""none"", alpha=0.5, hue=""Label"", palette=palette

The function `plot_training(hist)` is used to visualize the training and validation loss and accuracy during the training of a model.

- **Function Parameter**:
    - `hist`: History object that contains the model's loss and accuracy metrics at each epoch.

- **Inside the Function**:
    - `tr_acc`, `tr_loss`, `val_acc`, `val_loss`: Extracts the training accuracy, training loss, validation accuracy, and validation loss respectively from the history object.
    - `index_loss` and `val_lowest`: Identifies the epoch at which the validation loss was the lowest.
    - `index_acc` and `acc_highest`: Identifies the epoch at which the validation accuracy was the highest.
    - `Epochs`: A list of epoch numbers.
    - `loss_label` and `acc_label`: Strings that represent the epoch number with the lowest validation loss and highest validation accuracy respectively.
    - Initializes a matplotlib figure and styles it using the 'ggplot' style.
    - Plots the training and validation loss on the first subplot and annotates the point with the lowest validation loss.
    - Plots the training and validation accuracy on the second subplot and annotates the point with the highest validation accuracy.","Write Python code to define a function called plot_training that takes a hist object as an argument.

#  📊Exploratory Data Analysis
###  🤼‍Partnership Data Analysis
####  🗺️Top 10 Partnerships in IPL","To generate the Python code for the given instructions, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.graph_objects as go
```
2. Load the data into a pandas DataFrame:
```
ball_data = pd.read_csv(""ball_data.csv"")
```
3. Group the data by the required columns and calculate the partnership:
```
partnership_data = (
    ball_data.groupby(
        [""id"", ""season"", ""first_batter"", ""second_batter"", ""battingteam"", ""bowlingteam""]
    )
   .agg(partnership=(""total_runs"", ""sum""))
   .reset_index()
)
```
4. Sort the partnership data by the partnership value in descending order and select the top 10 rows:
```
top10_partnerships = partnership_data.sort_values(
    by=""partnership"", ascending=False
).head(10)
```
5. Sort the top 10 partnerships by the partnership value in ascending order:
```
top10_partnerships = top10_partnerships.sort_values(by=""partnership"", ascending=True)
```
6. Create a plotly figure with a bar chart:
```
fig = go.Figure(
    data=px.bar(
        x=top10_partnerships.battingteam,
        y=top10_partnerships.partnership,
        color=top10_partnerships.first_batter

        text=top10_partnerships.partnership,
        height=500,
    )
)
```
7. Customize the layout of the figure:
```
fig.update_layout(
    font_family=""Courier New"",
    title_font_family=""Times New Roman"",
    title_font_color=""red"",
    title_font_size=20,
    xaxis_title=""<b>Batting Team</b>"",
    yaxis_title=""<b>Partnership</b>"",
    legend_title_font_color=""green"",
)
```
8. Display the figure:
```
fig.show()
```
The resulting code will create a bar chart that displays the top 10 partnerships in the IPL history, with the partnership value on the y-axis and the batting team on the x-axis. The chart will also include the first and second batters in the partnership, with different colors for each partnership.

3104,193,4,"## QLoRA Algorithm for Fine-tuning Falcon 7b with torchkeras Knowledge

In this section, we will employ the QLoRA algorithm to fine-tune the Falcon 7b model, infusing knowledge related to torchkeras and the dreamy world.

### Basics of LoRA and QLoRA Algorithms

**1. LoRA**

LoRA, short for Low Rank Adaption, is an algorithm designed to significantly reduce training time and memory usage compared to full-parameter fine-tuning. Introduced by Microsoft in 2021, LoRA adopts a concept reminiscent of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

The core idea involves maintaining the pretrained parameter matrix unchanged while learning two small low-rank matrices beside it. The product of these matrices serves as the increment for the large parameter matrix that requires modification.

The mathematical representation is as follows:

$$W = W_0 + \Delta W = W_0 + B A$$

$$shape(W_0)=(m,n), shape(B) = (m,r), shape(A) = (r,n), r<<min(m,n)$$

During initialization, the \(B\) matrix is set to zero, and the \(A\) matrix is randomly initialized. This ensures that during the initial phase, the increment \(\Delta W\) is a zero matrix, having no impact on the inference results.


## QLoRA Algorithm

QLoRA, an abbreviation for Quantized LoRA, offers further memory savings and enhanced fine-tuning compared to LoRA.

### Innovations in QLoRA

**a. NF4 Data Type:**
Introducing NF4 (4-bit NormalFloat), a quantized data type with meticulous design. This data type achieves high compression rates (approximately 1/4 of fp16) while maintaining exceptional precision.

**b. Double Quantization Method:**
Quantizes constant parameters used in the NF4 data type, further reducing storage overhead.

**c. Paged Optimizers Technique:**
Utilizes NVIDIA unified memory features, enabling automatic page conversion between CPU and GPU memory. In cases of insufficient GPU memory, the optimizer's state is automatically transferred to CPU memory.

To implement the QLoRA algorithm, it requires the use of the `bitsandbytes` and `peft` libraries.

### Why QLoRA Enhances Performance over LoRA?

QLoRA achieves improved results primarily because of substantial storage savings, allowing for fine-tuning of more weight matrices. While LoRA typically fine-tunes Linear layers related to attention, QLoRA fine-tunes all Linear layers used in the model. This broader optimization space often leads to superior fine-tuning results.

# Finetuning","This code is a Python script that fine-tunes a pre-trained language model (Falcon 7b) for a specific task using the PEFT algorithm. The script first imports the necessary libraries, including PEFT, bitsandbytes, and transformers. It then defines a PEFT configuration using LoraConfig and obtains a PEFT model using the specified configuration and the original model. The script then configures the PEFT model for parallelization and prints the trainable parameters of the model.

Next, the script defines training arguments for fine-tuning Falcon 7b using the SFTTrainer class. The script then creates a trainer for supervised fine-tuning using the SFTTrainer class and starts the training process for supervised fine-tuning. Finally, the script saves the fine-tuned model to a specified directory.

Keeping this in mind, a Governmental Maritime and Coastguard Agency is planning to deploy a computer vision based automated system to identify ship type only from the images taken by the survey boats. You have been hired as a consultant to build an efficient model for this project.There are 5 classes of ships to be detected which are as follows:

* Cargo
* Military
* Carrier
* Cruise
* Tankers

 - Used Pytorch Pretrained Models
 - Used Resnet50, Resnet152 and Resnet101
 - Final Submission is result of votings based on 3 submission files created from 3 different models:
     - Image size 224x224
     - Data Augmenation
     - Stratified Sampling split for training and validation data because of data imbalance
     - Pre-trained network(resnet50, Resnet152 and Resnet101) - Unfreezed All Layers

Write Python code to define a function called `get_lr_callback` that takes two arguments: `batch_size` and `plot`. The function should return a `tf.keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler` object that adjusts the learning rate of a model during training. The learning rate should be adjusted according to the schedule defined in the code. If the `plot` argument is set to `True`, the function should also plot the learning rate schedule using Matplotlib.

Here is the code for the function:

1.1 Background


Welcome to this competition on predicting **Cervical Spine Fractures** from **Computed Tomography (CT) scans**. The **motivation** to use AI for this task is that a **quick** diagnosis can **reduce** the chance of **neurologic deterioration** and paralysis after trauma.





**Dataset origin**

The dataset we are using is made up of roughly **3000 CT studies**, [from twelve locations and across six continents](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-2022-cervical-spine-fracture-detection/overview/acknowledgements). Spine **radiology specialists** have provided **annotations** to indicate the presence, vertebral level and location of any cervical spine fractures.

Special thanks to the competition **hosts** for providing such a comprehensive dataset:
* *Radiological Society of North America (RSNA)*
* *American Society of Neuroradiology (ASNR)*
* *American Society of Spine Radiology (ASSR)*


1.2 Evaluation metric


We need to predict the **probability of fracture** for each of the **seven cervical vertebrae** denoted by C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6 and C7 as well as an **overall probability** of any fractures in the cervical spine. This means there will be **8 rows per image id** in the submission file. Note that fractures in the skull base, thoracic spine, ribs, and clavicles are **ignored**.
    
The **competition metric** is a **weighted multi-label logarithmic loss** (averaged across all patients)
    
$$
L_{ij} = - w_j \left(y_{ij} \log(p_{ij}) + (1-y_{ij}) \log(1-p_{ij})  \right)
$$

where the **weights** [are given by](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-2022-cervical-spine-fracture-detection/discussion/340392)
    
$$
w_{j} = \begin{cases}
1, \qquad \text{if vertebrae negative} \\
2, \qquad \text{if vertebrae positive} \\
7, \qquad \text{if patient negative} \\
14, \qquad \text{if patient positive}
\end{cases}
$$





Notice how **more weight** is put on **positive cases** and and the **most weight** on the **overall probability** of any fractures.



**Example:**

Below is a table going through an example of **how the evaluation metric is calculated** for a single case id. This would then be **averaged** across all case id's.





Note: it is convention to use the **natural logarithm** (base e) for calculating the log loss. 

NB: it [has been suggested](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-2022-cervical-spine-fracture-detection/discussion/344565) that the loss is then also **scaled** by the **sum of weights** on a by-patient basis. So for our example above, the weights were [2,1,1,1,2,1,1,14] which sums to 23 hence the loss would actually be 3.734/23 = 0.162. 



1.3 Code requirements


This is a **code competition**, which means that **submissions** are made through **notebooks**. Furthermore, the submission notebook is subject to these conditions:

* **run-time** (CPU/GPU) **<= 9 hours**
* **internet** access **disabled**
* **external data is allowed**, including pre-trained models
* the submission file must be named **submission.csv**
              
Note that the **test set is hidden**, and will populated when you submit your notebook. 



*Competition timeline:*
    
* Start date - 28th July 2022
* Finish date - 27th October 2022

## Abstract

This notebook highlights existing literature around ethics and the social
sciences in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. See the [task submission page
in the CORD-19 research
challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks?taskId=563)
for more backgorund.

## Introduction

The tasks in this notebook are tackled in a manually driven way. I am not a subject expert, but 
am interested in learning about the ethics of a pandemic. There are difficult choices that need to be made by people
and governments around the world that can
be tackled in a principled and reasoned way. For example, in overwhelmed hospitals, who should recieve scarce resources?
When is it okay to relax non-medical interventions and allow people to begin resuming their everyday lives?

I've gathered a list of references while researching the various tasks. For each reference, I collect a 
digital object identifier (DOI) and assign it a tag related to the task. Then I assign a score between 1
and 3 to reflect my confidence of the relevance to the task. Refer to the following tables for defintions.

`tag` | summarized title
-|-
`principles` | Ethical principles and standards relevant to COVID-19
`practice` | Ethics in practice
`outreach` | Ethics outreach
`organization` | Integrating social sciences within WHO
`quality` | Qualitative frameworks for evaluating public health measures
`risk` | Burdens and needs of care providers
`perception` | Underlying drivers of fear, anxiety, and stigma

`relevanceScore` | meaning
-|-
1 | weak relevance
2 | relevance
3 | strong relevant

For each DOI or other identifier, I query Semantic Scholar and record the results. I use the number of times
a paper has been cited as a rough indicator for quality. 

I may include a summary directly answering the question in the task. I try my best to choose 
high quality or relevant papers from my search in the summaries. My exploration of papers primarily 
occured on https://covid.curiosity.ai. Thank you Curiosity for putting together a great search engine.

While the process here has been wholly manual, I've gained some familiarity with the existing
research across many disciplines with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic. Future work could include 
automatically surfacing relevant papers by topic and citations in a semi-supervised
fashion, with qualitative surveys of the ranking results as (noisy) labeled data.","Write Python code to import the Semantic Scholar library, import the pandas library, and import the IPython display library. Then, define a function called fetch_semantic_scholar that takes a dictionary of tagged papers as input and returns a pandas DataFrame of the results. The function should append the semantic scholar response with other metadata, and then return a pandas DataFrame of the results.

Next, define a function called filter_results that takes a pandas DataFrame and an optional tag as input. The function should filter the DataFrame based on the tag, and then return a new DataFrame with the columns ""tag"", ""firstAuthor"", ""year"", ""title"", ""relevanceScore"", ""numCitations"", ""influentialCitationCount"", ""venue"", and ""queryId"". The function should sort the DataFrame by the relevance score and the number of citations in descending order.","import semanticscholar as sch

8607,2440,17,"In the violin plots above, we can see that the distributions of *center_x* for large vehicles including trucks, buses, and other vehicles are well spread. They barely have any skew and have greater means than the distributions for pedestrians and bicycles. This is probably because these large vehicles tend to keep greater distances from the other vehicles, and the smaller vehicles do not stay too close to these large vehicles in order to avoid accidents. Therefore, the mean *center_x* is clearly greater for larger vehicles like buses and trucks.

Contrastingly, the smaller objects like pedestrians and bicycles have *center_x* distributions with strong positive (rightward) skews. These distributions also have clearly lower means than the distributions for the larger vehicles. This is probably because pedestrians (road-crossers) and bicyclists do not need to maintain large distances with cars and trucks to avoid accidents.

5904,966,3,"# Data CleaningBefore we can apply machine learning algorithms we have to preprocess our text data. Here's how to clean your text data.

- Remove all irrelevant characters such as any non alphanumeric characters
- Tokenize your text by separating it into individual words
- Remove words that are not relevant, such as “@” twitter mentions or urls(if any)
- Convert all characters to lowercase(**Case folding**), in order to treat words such as “hello”, “Hello”, and “HELLO” the same. ******
- Consider combining misspelled or alternately spelled words to a single representation (e.g. “cool”/”kewl”/”cooool”)
- Consider lemmatization (reduce words such as “am”, “are”, and “is” to a common form such as “be”)
- Consider removing stopwords (such as a, an, the, be)etc.

**Note** : For tasks like speech recognition and information retrieval, everything is mapped to lower case. For sentiment analysis and other text classification tasks, information extraction, and machine translation, by contrast, case is quite helpful and case folding is generally not done (losing the difference, for example, between **US the country and us the pronoun** can outweigh the advantage in generality that case folding provides)","Write Python code to print the first review in the ""headline"" column of the ""train"" DataFrame.","# Check the first review

* `Domain Knowledge`: In general, domain knowledge is important when posing the question you want answered from data, as well as understanding the limitations of the data. If you don't understand these things (e.g., if you're working with a client on a new problem), then an essential skill is being able to ask the right questions to tease these things out.
* `Basic statistics on the dataset`
* `Extensive EDA`
* `Visualization of spatial maps`
* `Sample Submission`


**This kernel will be a work in Progress,and I will keep on updating it as the competition progresses**
    
**Please upvote this kernel if you like it . It motivates me to produce more quality content :)**# Domain Knowledge

So lets start with the domain knowledge and Address the few important questions


### Q1) What is the motivation behind this competition?

Human brain research is among the most complex areas of study for scientists. We know that age and other factors can affect its function and structure, but more research is needed into what specifically occurs within the brain. With much of the research using MRI scans, data scientists are well positioned to support future insights. In particular, neuroimaging specialists look for measurable markers of behavior, health, or disorder to help identify relevant brain regions and their contribution to typical or symptomatic effects.

The competition(TReNDS) is meant to encourage approaches able to predict age plus additional continuous individual-level assessment values, given multimodal brain features such as 3D functional spatial maps from resting-state functional MRI, static functional network connectivity (FNC) matrices, and source-based morphometry (SBM) loading values from structural MRI. For this task, one of the largest datasets of unbiased multimodal brain imaging features is made available. Given a set of multimodal imaging features, the developed predictors should output age and assessment predictions.

3902,1164,8,"## 5.2 Turn Common Words into Features

**Approach**

Due to the curse of dimensionality, doing this step with all our 1,000 articles would take prohibitively long. (10 authors * 100 articles/ea = 1,000 articles)  At 30 seconds per article, my personal machine would need 8.5 hours of processing. Therefore I'll limit this part to 50 articles per author. This should still convey enough information for a decent predictive model.

**About 'Common Bag of Words'**

This technique consists of creating a feature out of each common word and then counting the number of times each common word appears in each article. Each cell will represent the number of times the lemma of the given column appears in the article of the current row. We have over 3,000 common words, and will be using 500 articles total. (50 per author) Plus each article may have a varying number of words in it.

2695,1488,5,"# Attention Model
The basic idea is that a Global Average Pooling is too simplistic since some of the regions are more relevant than others. So we build an attention mechanism to turn pixels in the GAP on an off before the pooling and then rescale (Lambda layer) the results based on the number of pixels. The model could be seen as a sort of 'global weighted average' pooling. There is probably something published about it and it is very similar to the kind of attention models used in NLP.
It is largely based on the insight that the winning solution annotated and trained a UNET model to segmenting the hand and transforming it. This seems very tedious if we could just learn attention.","Write Python code to train a Keras model using the VGG16 model as a pre-trained base model, and using an attention mechanism to selectively focus on certain parts of the input data.

Détection de race de chienà partir d'images grâce aux réseaux de neurones à convolution

L'objectif de ce Notebook est de détailler la mise en place d'un **algorithme de détection de la race du chien sur une photo**, afin d'accélérer le travail d’indexation dans une base de données.

### Les contraintes imposées :
- **Pré-processer les images** avec des techniques spécifiques *(e.g. whitening, equalization, éventuellement modification de la taille des images)*.
- Réaliser de la **data augmentation** *(mirroring, cropping...)*.
- Mise en oeuvre de 2 approches de l'utilisation des CNN :
    - Réaliser un réseau de neurones CNN from scratch en optimisant les paramètres.     
    - Utiliser le transfert learning et ainsi utiliser un réseau déjà entrainé.
    
### Repo et interface de test en ligne :
Un repo Git est disponible pour ce projet à l'adresse : https://github.com/MikaData57/ingenieur-ml-computer-vision-cnn.
Ce repo reprend ce Notebook versionné ainsi que l'architecture de déploiement sur Heroku *(spécifique pour Tensorflow, OpenCV et Gradio)*.

***Overall Tf-idf by title is the most effective search however free text is also effective***

***TF-IDF is also the least computational taxing, which means it is faster to run than the k-nearest neighbor approach***


- Search by an existing query
    - Search by replacing the title variable with any of the queries above(eg, txt1,txt2,infoShare1,riskFactors[1], surveil1,considerations1,etc) into tfIdfSearch
- Search by article title
    - These searches produce the best results because they include many more words to compare term frequencies across mutliple documents
- Search by free text
    - Searches with free text will produce results less comprehensive than by title search because there is less text to compare term frequencies across documents

5. Sort the documents in descending order of their similarity to the query.

$$ S(t) = P(T > t)$$

解釈: 時刻 $t$ までに、ある事象が発生しない確率。

$T ~~(T \geq 0)$ を確率変数、$S(t)=1-F(t)$をその生存関数とするとき、
$$E[T]=\int^{\infty}_0S(t)dt$$
が成り立ちます。## 指数分布の場合

パラメータ$\lambda$の指数分布の確率密度関数は
$$f\left( x\right) =\begin{cases}\lambda e^{-\lambda x}\enspace \left( x\geqq 0\right) \\ 0 \enspace \left( x <0\right) \end{cases}$$
であり、
$$F(x)=\int^x_0\lambda e^{-\lambda x}dx=1-e^{-\lambda x}$$
が成り立つので、瞬間故障率は
$$\frac{f(x)}{1-F(x)}=\lambda$$
となります。## 生存時間解析の種類

生存時間解析には3つの種類があります:

パラメトリック: 生存時間が特定の確率分布に従う → ワイブル分布、指数分布、対数正規分布など。

セミパラメトリック: コックス回帰。

ノンパラメトリック: 生存確率が時間に関連する → カプラン＝マイヤー法など。## メディアン生存時間(MST, median survival time)

生存率曲線において，累積生存率が 50% になるときの時間。## カプランマイヤー法
カプランマイヤー法とは、打ち切りのあるデータにおいて生存時間の分布を図示する方法であり、カプランマイヤー法を用いてプロットした生存曲線をカプランマイヤー曲線といいます。 各時点の累積生存率を示しており、対象集団における生存の状況を視覚的に把握することができます。カプランマイヤープロットは、第$i$番目の観測時点$t_j (j=1, \cdots, N)$でのリスク集合のサイズを$n_j$とし、故障数をd_jとしたとき

$$S(t)=\prod^N_{j=1}\left( 1-\frac{d_j}{n_j}\right)$$

Paper: [“An Image is Worth 16×16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)

* ViT breaks an input image of 16×16 to a  sequence of patches, just like a series of word embeddings generated by an NLP Transformers. 
* Each patch gets flattened into a single vector in a series of interconnected channels of all pixels in a patch, then projects it to desired input dimension.
* Because transformers operate in self-attention mode, and they do not necessarily depend on the structure of the input elements, which in turns helps the architecture to learn and relate sparsely-distributed information more efficiently.
* The relationship between the patches in an image is not known and thus allows it to learn more relevant features from the training data and encode in positional embedding in ViT.

6. Return the average loss over the entire training set

Write Python code to define a function called `valid_fn` that takes in the following arguments:

* `files`: a list of files to be used for validation
* `model`: a PyTorch model
* `criterion`: a PyTorch loss function
* `device`: the device (e.g. CPU or GPU) to use for validation

The function should perform the following actions:

1. Switch to evaluation mode
2. Load the validation data using a TFRecordDataLoader
3. Compute the loss for each batch of data
4. Append the predictions and targets to lists
5. Measure the elapsed time and print a progress message
6. Return the average loss over the entire validation set, as well as the predictions and targets.[/INST] ```

The second function, `tune`, takes in a DataFrame, a target variable, and a model function as input, and trains the model using the data, but with the `early_stopping_rounds` parameter set to a large value to allow for more iterations. The function then saves the best-performing model to a file.

1637,2068,4,"## 2.3 LEVERAGING MIXED PRECISION

---

Mixed precision is the use of both **`16-bit`** and **`32-bit`** floating-point types in a model during training to make it run faster and use less memory. By keeping certain parts of the model in the **`32-bit`** types for numeric stability, the model will have a lower step time and train equally as well in terms of the evaluation metrics such as accuracy. 

Today, most models use the **`float32`** dtype, which takes **`32`** bits of memory. However, there are two lower-precision dtypes, **`float16`** and **`bfloat16`**, each which take **`16`** bits of memory instead. Modern accelerators can run operations faster in the **`16-bit`** dtypes, as they have specialized hardware to run **`16-bit`** computations and **`16-bit`** dtypes can be read from memory faster.

**NVIDIA GPUs** can run operations in **`float16`** faster than in **`float32`**
**TPUs** can run operations **`bfloat16`** faster than in **`float32`**

Therefore, these lower-precision dtypes should be used whenever possible on those devices. However, variables and a few computations should still be in **`float32`** for numeric reasons so that the model trains to the same quality. 

The Keras mixed precision API allows you to use a mix of either **`float16`** or **`bfloat16`** with **`float32`**, to get the performance benefits from **`float16/bfloat16`** and the numeric stability benefits from **`float32`**.

📖   DEFINITION:- The term ""numeric stability"" refers to how a model's quality is affected by the use of a lower-precision dtype instead of a higher precision dtype. We say an operation is ""numerically unstable"" in float16 or bfloat16 if running it in one of those dtypes causes the model to have worse evaluation accuracy or other metrics compared to running the operation in float32.

Netflix - EDA 


In this project, we will do some analysis by looking at the data of movies and TV shows on Netflix. As a result of these analyzes:
- How many Netflix content has been produced in which country?
- How many movies and TV shows?
- What are the categories of content available on Netflix? Which movie categories have the most and least published content?
- How is Netflix content according to the rating order?
- What are the publishing dates and production dates of content on Netlix?
- Which age groups are the content on Netflix targeting?
- Which players are the most featured in Netflix content?
- What are the durations of movies and TV shows on Netflix?

We will answer these and similar questions in this project.### Data Loading","Write Python code to import the necessary packages, including pandas, numpy, seaborn, datetime, plotly.express, and collections.

The code is using the Plotly library to create the heatmap. It first imports the necessary libraries, including Plotly and NumPy. It then creates a DataFrame df1 with the same columns as df, but with an additional column for the year. It then loops through each year in the DataFrame and creates a sparse matrix of the values in the column 'column_name' for that year. It then multiplies the sparse matrix by its transpose, and sets the diagonal to zero. It then converts the sparse matrix to a dense matrix and creates a DataFrame with the same columns as df1, but with the values for the current year. It then divides the values in the DataFrame by the number of rows in the DataFrame to get the percentage of each value for the current year. It then multiplies the values by 100 to get the percentage. It then creates a new DataFrame occ with the same columns as df1, but with the percentage values for the current year. It then concatenates the DataFrame occ with the DataFrame df1.

The code then creates a Plotly figure with a heatmap of the values in the column 'column_name' of the DataFrame df1 for the year 2022. It then creates a list of buttons for each year in the DataFrame, and adds them to the Plotly figure. It then updates the layout of the Plotly figure to include the buttons and the heatmap.

<</SYS>>

Write Python code to create a heatmap of the values in the column 'column_name' of a DataFrame df, and display the plot.

The code is using the Plotly library to create the heatmap. It first imports the necessary libraries, including Plotly and NumPy. It then creates a DataFrame df1 with the same columns as df, but with an additional column for the year. It then loops through each year in the DataFrame and creates a sparse matrix of the values in the column 'column_name' for that year. It then multiplies the sparse matrix by its transpose, and sets the diagonal to zero. It then converts the sparse matrix to a dense matrix and creates a DataFrame with the same columns as df1, but with the values for the current year. It then divides the values in the DataFrame by the number of rows in the DataFrame to get the percentage of each value for the current year. It then multiplies the values by 100 to get the percentage. It then creates a new DataFrame occ with the same columns as df1, but with the percentage values for the current year. It then concatenates the DataFrame occ with the DataFrame df1.

The code then creates a Plotly figure with a heatmap of the values in the column 'column_name' of the DataFrame df1 for the year 2022. It then creates a list of buttons for each year in the DataFrame, and adds them to the Plotly figure. It then updates the layout of the Plotly figure to include the buttons and the heatmap. It then adds an annotation to the Plotly figure to display the text ""Select Year:"". Finally, it shows the Plotly figure.[/INST] ```

#   4. Building the Combined Model 


As explained in the second article of this series to train the generator, we need to build a combined network that contains both the generator and the discriminator. The combined model takes the noise signal as input (z) and outputs the discriminator’s prediction output as fake or real.



It is important to remember that we want to disable discriminator training for the combined model. When training the generator, we don’t want the discriminator to update weights as well, but we still want to include the discriminator model in the generator training. So, we create a combined network that includes both models but freezes the weights of the discriminator model in the combined network:","Write Python code to define an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0002 and beta_1 of 0.5, and use it to compile a discriminator model. The discriminator model should be defined using the build_discriminator function, and should be trained on a binary cross-entropy loss function with accuracy as a metric. The discriminator model should also be set to be non-trainable.

Next, define a generator model using the build_generator function, and use it to generate images from a random noise vector z.

Finally, define a combined model that takes z as input and outputs the validity of the generated image. The combined model should be compiled with a binary cross-entropy loss function and the same Adam optimizer as the discriminator.","optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.0002, beta_1=0.5)

Write Python code to perform histogram equalization on an image using OpenCV.

Here's a possible solution:
```
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load the image
img = cv2.imread(""image.jpg"")

# Convert the image to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Perform histogram equalization
equ = cv2.equalizeHist(gray)

# Display the original and equalized images
cv2.imshow(""Original"", img)
cv2.imshow(""Equalized"", equ)
cv2.waitKey(0)

7926,1179,20,"### accident type's counts
","Write Python code to calculate the average score for each type of accident, based on the number of occurrences of each type.

The code defines five lists: `accident_0_score`, `accident_1_score`, `accident_2_score`, `accident_3_score`, and `accident_4_score`. These lists are used to store the scores for each type of accident.

The code also defines a function called `get_score_list`, which takes two arguments: `a` and `b1`. `a` is a list of accident types, and `b1` is a list that will be used to store the scores for each type of accident.

The function loops through each element in `a` and checks if the current element is in the index of the `df[""Description""].value_counts()` series. If it is, the function appends the corresponding value from the `df[""Description""].value_counts().values` series to `b1`.

The function is called five times, once for each type of accident. Each time it is called, it appends the scores for that type of accident to the corresponding list.

The code then defines a list `x` with the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], which correspond to the types of accidents. It also defines a list `y` with the number of occurrences of each type of accident.

The code then uses the `matplotlib.pyplot` module to create a bar chart with the number of occurrences of each type of accident on the y-axis and the type of accident on the x-axis. The chart is labeled with the type of accident and the number of occurrences.

⚪ Furthermore, it is recommended to include any relevant context or constraints that should be considered during the text generation process. This could involve providing guidelines on the desired style, tone, or level of complexity for the questions and answers.

Object detection is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos. Object detection, unlike computer vision and image processing, involves finding the coordinates of the detected object on the image. With the coordinates found, the area where the object will be enclosed with a frame is also determined.

We'll do object detection in two different ways. I'm going to use some random photos for this.","Write Python code to import the necessary libraries, load the RetinaNet model, and use it to detect objects in images in a directory.

2. Load the RetinaNet model using the `ObjectDetection` class from the `imageai` library.

4. Load the model using the `loadModel` method.
5. Set the input directory to the location of the images to be detected.

Write Python code to import the necessary libraries, load the RetinaNet model, and use it to detect objects in images in a directory. The code should also save the detected objects in a new directory and display the results using Matplotlib.

Here's the instruction:

1. Import the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow.
2. Load the RetinaNet model using the `ObjectDetection` class from the `imageai` library.
3. Set the model type to RetinaNet and set the model path to the location of the pre-trained model.
4. Load the model using the `loadModel` method.
5. Set the input directory to the location of the images to be detected.
6. Use the `detectObjectsFromImage` method to detect objects in each image in the input directory.
7. Save the detected objects in a new directory.
8. Display the results using Matplotlib.

7576,2091,1,"# What is HAR ?
- Human activity recognition, or HAR for short, is a broad field of study concerned with identifying the specific movement or action of a person based on sensor data. 
- Movements are often typical activities performed indoors, such as walking, talking, standing, and sitting# Why it is important ?- Human activity recognition plays a significant role in human-to-human interaction and interpersonal relations. 
- Because it provides information about the identity of a person, their personality, and psychological state, it is difficult to extract. 
- The human ability to recognize another person’s activities is one of the main subjects of study of the scientific areas of computer vision and machine learning. As a result of this research, many applications, including video surveillance systems, human-computer interaction, and robotics for human behavior characterization, require a multiple activity recognition system.#  Here are some example:# What is VGG16?

- The VGG model, or VGGNet, that supports 16 layers is also referred to as VGG16, which is a convolutional neural network model proposed by A. Zisserman and K. Simonyan from the University of Oxford. These researchers published their model in the research paper titled, [“Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition.”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556)

- The VGG16 model achieves almost 92.7% top-5 test accuracy in ImageNet. ImageNet is a dataset consisting of more than 14 million images belonging to nearly 1000 classes. Moreover, it was one of the most popular models submitted to ILSVRC-2014. It replaces the large kernel-sized filters with several 3×3 kernel-sized filters one after the other, thereby making significant improvements over AlexNet. The VGG16 model was trained using Nvidia Titan Black GPUs for multiple weeks.

- As mentioned above, the VGGNet-16 supports 16 layers and can classify images into 1000 object categories, including keyboard, animals, pencil, mouse, etc. Additionally, the model has an image input size of 224-by-224.  # HAR using VGG16### Importing library","Write Python code to import the following libraries:

Write Python code to define a class named StatLogger, which initializes the Logger. The class has the following attributes:

* train_loss: a list to store the training loss values
* train_acc: a list to store the training accuracy values
* val_loss: a list to store the validation loss values
* val_acc: a list to store the validation accuracy values
* val_lsd: a list to store the validation loss-to-signal ratio values
* step: a list to store the training step values
* epoch: a list to store the training epoch values
* lr: a list to store the learning rate values

The class also has the following methods:

* print_last_val: a method to print the last validation accuracy, loss, and LSD values
* print_current_train: a method to print the current training accuracy, loss, and learning rate values

The method print_last_val takes the current time as an argument and prints the last validation accuracy, loss, and LSD values in a tight format. The method print_current_train takes the current step, training accuracy, training loss, batch loss, current time, and current learning rate as arguments and prints the current training accuracy, loss, and learning rate values in a tight format.[/INST] ```

# Note:Hi everyone !!!!

My name is Vinay Vikram, I am DL/NLP/CV research engineer. Especially I am in Love with Computer Vision.. What about NLP ( Currently not practicing a lot) .

Today I would like to share with you, My approach to any of the hackathons,But With this kernel I have no intention to ruin the competition spirit, it is created to just help you to get started.

- I am a regular participants of Analytics vidhya hackathons and multiple time i featured among top 10 Ranking.

More about me: [Check My website](https://vikramvinay.github.io/)## About the Hackathon

Recently we have observed the emerging concept of smart farming that makes agriculture more efficient and effective with the help of high-precision algorithms. The mechanism that drives it is Machine Learning — the scientific field that gives machines the ability to learn without being strictly programmed. It has emerged together with big data technologies and high-performance computing to create new opportunities to unravel, quantify, and understand data intensive processes in agricultural operational environments.

> Machine learning is everywhere throughout the whole growing and harvesting cycle. It begins with a seed being planted in the soil — from the soil preparation, seeds breeding and water feed measurement — and it ends when neural networks pick up the harvest determining the ripeness with the help of computer vision.## Problem Statement

```The Toxic Pesticides```

Though, many of us don't appreciate much, but a farmer's job is real test of endurance and determination. Once the seeds are sown, he works days and nights to make sure that he cultivates a good harvest at the end of season. A good harvest is ensured by several factors such as availability of water, soil fertility, protecting crops from rodents, timely use of pesticides & other useful chemicals and nature. While a lot of these factors are difficult to control for, the amount and frequency of pesticides is something the farmer can control.

Pesticides are also special, because while they protect the crop with the right dosage. But, if you add more than required, they may spoil the entire harvest. A high level of pesticide can deem the crop dead / unsuitable for consumption among many outcomes. This data is based on crops harvested by various farmers at the end of harvest season. To simplify the problem, you can assume that all other factors like variations in farming techniques have been controlled for.

- You need to daetermine the outcome of the harvest season, i.e. whether the crop would be healthy (alive), damaged by pesticides or damaged by other reasons.## Data Description| Column Name                       | Description                                                                                        |

# Set the interactivity level to ""all""

Explanation:

1. The first step is to import the necessary libraries, including `imageio`, `IPython.core.interactiveshell`, `IPython.display`, and `pathlib`.
2. Next, we set the interactivity level to ""all"" using `InteractiveShell.ast_node_interactivity = ""all""`. This allows us to execute the code in the cell.
3. We create a list of images by reading each PNG file in the ""frames"" directory using `imageio.imread()`. We append each image to the list.
4. We save the GIF file using `imageio.mimsave()`. The first argument is the name of the GIF file, and the second argument is the list of images.
5. Finally, we display the GIF file using `display()`. The `Image` function is used to create an image object from the GIF file, and the `format` argument is set to ""png"" to display the GIF file as a PNG image.","# @title Visualize the training process

## 4. Loading and Exploring Spatial Maps
Here we will see, how to load and display subject spatial map information for fMRI spatial maps. In general the spatial maps are saved as 4-D tensors

𝑖∈ℝ𝑋×𝑌×𝑍×𝐾
 
where  𝑋 ,  𝑌 , and  𝑍  are the three spatial dimensions of the volume, and  𝐾  is the number of independent components.**File Format**

The subject spatial maps have been saved in .mat files using the v7.3 flag, so they must be loaded as h5py datasets, and a nifti file must be used to set the headers for display purposes. We have included the load_subject function, which takes a subject .mat filename, and the loaded nilearn image to use for setting the headers.

","Write Python code to load a subject's spatial map from a.mat file, and display it using the ch2better template image.

The code first loads the mask image and the subject's data from the input files. It then defines a function called `load_subject` that takes the subject's data and the mask image as input, and returns a new image object with the subject's data, using the mask image as a template for the nifti headers.

The code then calls the `load_subject` function with the subject's data and the mask image as input, and stores the resulting image object in the `subject_niimg` variable. It then prints the shape of the subject's image, and detects the number of spatial maps in the image.

The final step is to display the subject's image using the ch2better template image. This can be done using the `display` function from the `matplotlib.pyplot` module, and passing in the `subject_niimg` and `smri_filename` variables as input.","# Download the ch2better template image for display

[Albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/) is a Python library for fast and flexible image augmentations. Albumentations efficiently implements a rich variety of image transform operations that are optimized for performance, and does so while providing a concise, yet powerful image augmentation interface for different computer vision tasks, including object classification, segmentation, and detection.

Data augmentation is done by the following techniques:

1. Random Cropping
2. Horizontal Flipping
3. Vertical Flipping
4. Rotation
5. Random Brightness & Contrast
6. Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)
7. Grid Distortion
8. Optical Distortion","Write Python code to perform data augmentation on an image and its corresponding mask using the Albumentations library. The code should include the following steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries, including Albumentations and OpenCV.
2. Load the image and mask using OpenCV.
3. Define a function called `augment` that takes in the width and height of the image as inputs and returns a transformation object. The function should use the Albumentations library to perform the following data augmentation operations:
	* Random crop
	* Horizontal flip
	* Vertical flip
	* Rotation
	* Random brightness and contrast
	* One of the following distortion operations:
		+ CLAHE
		+ Grid distortion
		+ Optical distortion
4. Define a function called `visualize` that takes in the transformed image, mask, original image, and original mask as inputs and displays the visualization using Matplotlib.
5. Call the `augment` function with the width and height of the image as inputs and store the returned transformation object in a variable called `transform`.
6. Call the `transform` function with the image and mask as inputs and store the returned transformed image and mask in variables called `transformed_image` and `transformed_mask`, respectively.
7. Save the transformed image and mask to files using OpenCV.
8. Call the `visualize` function with the transformed image, mask, original image, and original mask as inputs.

# Kats

Facebook Research unit made its first appearance in this series thanks to Prophet, but it is far from their only contribution to time series - recently they released their own one-stop-shop in the form of `Kats`: https://facebookresearch.github.io/Kats/. The elevator pitch for `Kats` contains it with  generic analysis, forecasting, anomaly detection, multivariate analysis, and feature extraction/embedding. An interesting feature is that it incorporates both vintage methods like ARIMA and modern ones (based on LSTM). 


Kats implements an ensembling solution just like `darts` (choosing an implementation is a YMMV type of situation), but their take on backtesting has useful metrics info not available - at least not so easily - in darts.","Write Python code to import the Kats library, and use it to backtest the model on the energy_daily.csv dataset.

Here's the instruction:

1. Import the Kats library by running `from kats.models.prophet import ProphetModel, ProphetParams` and `from kats.models.holtwinters import HoltWintersParams, HoltWintersModel` and `from kats.models.arima import ARIMAModel, ARIMAParams`.
2. Import the backtester by running `from kats.utils.backtesters import BackTesterSimple`.
3. Load the energy_daily.csv dataset by running `df = pd.read_csv(CFG.data_folder + ""energy_daily.csv"")`.
4. Set the index of the dataframe to ""time"" by running `df.set_index(""time"")`.
5. Create a Kats TimeSeriesData object by running `df_ts = TimeSeriesData(df, time_col_name=""time"")`.
6. Specify the metrics you want to use for backtesting by running `ALL_ERRORS = [""mape"", ""smape"", ""mae"", ""mase"", ""mse"", ""rmse""]`.
7. Load the air_passengers.csv dataset by running `air_passengers_df = pd.read_csv(""air_passengers.csv"")`.
8. Set the index of the air_passengers_df to ""time"" by running `air_passengers_df.set_index(""time"")`.
9. Create a Kats TimeSeriesData object for the air_passengers dataset by running `air_passengers_ts = TimeSeriesData(air_passengers_df)`.
10. Backtest the model on the energy_daily dataset by running `backtester_errors = BackTesterSimple(df_ts, air_passengers_ts, ALL_ERRORS)`.

Note that this is just one possible way to backtest the model, and you may need to modify the code to fit your specific use case.","from kats.models.prophet import ProphetModel, ProphetParams

Write Python code to import the Kats library, and use it to backtest the model on the energy_daily.csv dataset.

Here's the instruction:

1. Import the Kats library by running `from kats.models.prophet import ProphetModel, ProphetParams` and `from kats.models.holtwinters import HoltWintersParams, HoltWintersModel` and `from kats.models.arima import ARIMAModel, ARIMAParams`.
2. Import the backtester by running `from kats.utils.backtesters import BackTesterSimple`.
3. Load the energy_daily.csv dataset by running `df = pd.read_csv(CFG.data_folder + ""energy_daily.csv"")`.
4. Set the index of the dataframe to ""time"" by running `df.set_index(""time"")`.
5. Create a Kats TimeSeriesData object by running `df_ts = TimeSeriesData(df, time_col_name=""time"")`.
6. Specify the metrics you want to use for backtesting by running `ALL_ERRORS = [""mape"", ""smape"", ""mae"", ""mase"", ""mse"", ""rmse""]`.
7. Load the air_passengers.csv dataset by running `air_passengers_df = pd.read_csv(""air_passengers.csv"")`.
8. Set the index of the air_passengers_df to ""time"" by running `air_passengers_df.set_index(""time"")`.
9. Create a Kats TimeSeriesData object for the air_passengers dataset by running `air_passengers_ts = TimeSeriesData(air_passengers_df)`.
10. Backtest the model on the energy_daily dataset by running `backtester_errors = BackTesterSimple(df_ts, air_passengers_ts, ALL_ERRORS)`.

Note that this is just one possible way to backtest the model, and you may need to modify the code to fit your specific use case.[/INST] ```

5868,1789,1,"# Data Science in 2020: NLP vs CV

In my experience*, people who work in data science are mostly specialized in either CV or NLP, but rarely work in both fields at the same time.

**TL;DR**: This notebook tries to find and explain any significant differences between people working in the two major subfields of data science.


#### Testable hypotheses
Before looking at the data, I came up with the following ideas:
* Subfield **specialisation will increase with years of ML experience / work experience / level of education**. For example, while DS students recieve general education and don't assosiate themselves with any particular field, DS professionals devote their time to particular sets of problems inside one field.

* **NLP is more heterogeneous** (in different ways, e.g., programming languages of choice). I believe this because, in my experience, there are much more things that people somehow relate to NLP than in the case with CV.

* There are **more female specialists in NLP** than in CV. I think so because NLP is somewhat related to lingustics which is popular among females, while CV doesn't have any such related field.


#### Methodology
My judgement of whether a person works in CV or NLP comes from answers the questions Q18 and Q19 (which CV / NLP methods do you use, respectively). If a person has chosen at least one item on either list, I count it as an evidence that they are somehow related to the corresponding field.


\* I am an NLP specialist from Russia. It might well be that my experience is not represantatve.### Data preparation","Write Python code to import the pandas and numpy libraries, and name them as pd and np respectively.

7796,3614,6,"*Now, let's look at does this graph corresponds to our experience. I will try to measure its correctness according to my readings. In this list, the philosophers that I have read are Heidegger, Marx, Russell, Plato, Hume, Kant; also as I remember, there are philosophers that I have heard about which are Deleuze, Derrida, Foucault.*
>*For Heidegger, I have read half of the ""Being and Time"" and I can say it was the most challenging book that I have read so far. It was so hard I had to drop on half of the book. Therefore I can say it makes sense to see Heidegger as the second hardest one.*


>*For Derrida, It's plausible to see Derrida in the third position because one of Derrida's most important ideas was ""Deconstruction."" Deconstruction is an idea that has been developed in contrast to Structuralism. In deconstruction, Derrida tried to show how language in the text can give different meanings and text is not superior to talk, so by knowing deconstruction texts which Derrida wrote can be deconstructed too, Derrida specifically wrote in a challenging way. Derrida is notorious for his writings which are so hard to understand, so seeing Derrida in there makes sense too.


>*For Deleuze and Foucault, I can just say postmodern thinkers wrote harder than others, so it makes sense to me, but it's open to discussion.


>*For Marx: I have read ""The Communist Manifesto"" and ""Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts,"" in these books, I can say it was comparatively easy. 


>*For Plato: I have read ""Apology of Socrates""& ""Republic,"" and these were after getting used to was easy. But at first, I had to get used to concepts like ""daimon,"" some greek words, some gods.


>*For Russell: I have read ""Western Philosophy History 1-2-3"", ""Why I Am Not a Christian"" & ""The Problems of Philosophy.""  I can say he is one of my favorite philosophers. He writes in a way that anyone can understand easily.

## Data Description**Input variables (based on physicochemical tests)**:
1. _fixed acidity_ : most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily).
2. _volatile acidity_ : the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste.
3. _citric acid_ : found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines.
4. _residual suga_ : the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet.
5. _chlorides_ : the amount of salt in the wine.
6. _free sulfur dioxide_ : the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine.
7. _total sulfur dioxide_ : amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine.
8. _density_ : the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content.
9. _pH_ : describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale.
10. _sulphates_ : a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.
11. _alcohol_ : the percent alcohol content of the wine.

**Output variable (based on sensory data)**:
12. _quality_ : score between 0 and 10 given by human wine tasters.

        UKRAINE Vs RUSSIA WAR EDA
    

    The Russo-Ukrainian War has been ongoing between Russia (alongside Russian separatists in Ukraine) and Ukraine since February 2014. Hostilities were initiated by Russia shortly after Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity and were focused on the political status of Crimea and the Donbas, which remain internationally recognized as part of Ukraine. Incursions into Ukrainian territory culminated in Russia's annexation of Crimea, followed shortly afterwards by the beginning of the war in Donbas between Russia-backed separatists and Ukrainian state forces; fighting for the first eight years of the conflict also included naval incidents, cyberwarfare, and heightened political tensions. Throughout 2021, bilateral tensions rose due to a Russian military buildup surrounding Ukrainian territory, and on 24 February 2022, the conflict saw a major escalation as Russia invaded mainland Ukraine.

2. `onehot_to_rgb`: This function takes an one-hot encoded image matrix and a colormap dictionary as input, and returns a decoded RGB image matrix of dimensions (height x width x 3). The function first finds the label for each pixel in the one-hot encoded image matrix using the colormap dictionary, and then sets the corresponding pixel value in the decoded RGB image matrix to the corresponding color.

The colormap dictionary should be a mapping from label IDs to RGB colors. For example, if the colormap dictionary is `id2code = {0: (0, 0, 0), 1: (255, 0, 0), 2: (0, 255, 0), 3: (0, 0, 255)}`, then the function will map the label 0 to the color (0, 0, 0), the label 1 to the color (255, 0, 0), and so on.[/INST] ```

**In this section we will explore simple recurrent neural networks and word embeddings to see how well these 'shallow' networks perform for binary sentiment extraction. After experimenting with LSTMs, we will see how the infamous [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) transformer**

## 1. Word Embeddings

**The following reference takes you step by step through the process of using word embeddings with Keras. I highly recommend you read it if just beginning with embeddings: https://blog.keras.io/using-pre-trained-word-embeddings-in-a-keras-model.html**

**One way to feed our model text data is to treat each word in our vocabulary as a separate feature and one hot encode them (Bag of Words encoding). This works and performs decently, but there is a major drawback to this approach**

### Mathematical intuition:

**We are interested in constructing a vector space to represent our words. Suppose our vocabulary is: 'cat', 'dog', 'plant', 'leaf', 'man', woman'. Then we can form a vector space via:**

$$ cat = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) $$
$$ dog = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0) $$
$$ plant = (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0) $$
$$ leaf = (0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0) $$
$$ man = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0) $$
$$ woman = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1) $$

**But these vectors form an orthogonal basis, so when we take the dot product of them, we get 0:**

$$ cat \cdot dog = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) \cdot (0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0) = 0$$

**This means that all of these vectors are as far as possible from each other in the vector space, i.e., they are not similar. But words like cat and dog are similar in meaning, so it would be great if our word encoddings could somehow capture this similarity**

**So, instead of following the Bag of Word approach, we will import the pre-trained words from GloVe and use them to construct our word embeddings. But what is GloVe?**  

> ""GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words. Training is performed on aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus, and the resulting representations showcase interesting linear substructures of the word vector space.""

**For example, we can take the vector for King and subtract the vector for Man and the resulting vector is remarkably close to the vector for Queen. Using these word encodings as opposed to the Bag of Word encodings will substantially improve our classification accuracy**

**Now, some of the GloVe embeddings actually have tokens for punctuation, so for completeness, I will show you how to include punctuation in your embeddings if you think it will improve the accuracy of your model:**","Write Python code to import the Keras Tokenizer class from the keras.preprocessing.text module, and create a Tokenizer object named tokenizer.

    We all know, when we talk about Machine Learning boosting methods, they kicks the asses of every other ML-Algos when it comes to tabular data
    
    Although, deeplearning has proved to be unreasonalby more effective in fields like Vision, Speech or Language, it haven't shown much effectiveness when it comes to     tabular data. 

Why Go Deeper?
Today, we can train machines to detect objects in images, extract meaning from text, stop spam emails, drive cars, discover new drug candidates, and beat top players in Chess, Go, and countless other games and most of the credit goes to deep-learning.

Machine doesn't understands the science/theory, all it does is generalises the ideas by visiting a lot of data, so lacking a perfect theory we have to rely on intutions.  Deeper Neural Network because it generalises more and overfits less. 
So, even if part of the face is hidden, the network will still pick up a signal from the remaining input, and therefore generalize better. It's a good intuition, and it appears to be what is actually happening. Experiments confirm that deep neural networks outperform shallow ones on common image as well as text tasks.

The `__init__` method initializes the vectorizer with the specified parameters, such as the vocabulary size, sequence length, and unknown token.

The `fit_transform` method takes a list of sentences as input and returns a list of vectors, where each vector represents a sentence. The method first counts the frequency of each word in the sentences and then creates a vocabulary based on the most frequent words. It then maps each word in the sentences to a unique integer index, and returns a list of vectors where each vector is a sequence of integers representing the words in the sentence.

The `transform` method takes a list of sentences as input and returns a list of vectors, where each vector represents a sentence. The method uses the pre-trained vocabulary and word index to map each word in the sentences to a unique integer index, and returns a list of vectors where each vector is a sequence of integers representing the words in the sentence.

The `load` method loads the pre-trained vectorizer from a file, and the `save` method saves the vectorizer to a file.

The script also defines a `modes` list with two elements, `0` and `1`, and a `mode` variable that is set to `0` or `1` depending on the mode of the script. The script then uses the `fit_transform` method to create a vectorizer for the training data, and the `transform` method to create vectors for the validation data. Finally, the script splits the training data into training and validation sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn, and stores the vectors in the `X_train`, `X_val`, `y_train`, and `y_val` variables.","class Vectorizer:

They may use fundamental, technical analysis, sentimental analysis,etc. to place their bet. As data is growing, many professionals use data to understand and analyse previous trends and predict the future prices to book profit.

**Competition Description:** The dataset provided contains set of features, **feature_{0...129}**,representing real stock market data. 
Each row in the dataset represents a trading opportunity, for which we will be predicting an action value: 1 to make the trade and 0 to pass on it. 
Each trade has an associated weight and resp, which together represents a return on the trade. 
In the training set, **train.csv**, you are provided a **resp** value, as well as several other **resp_{1,2,3,4}** values that represent returns over different time horizons.

In **Test set** we don't have **resp** value, and other **resp_{1,2,3,4}** data, so we have to use only **feature_{0...129}** to make prediction.

Trades with **weight = 0** were intentionally included in the dataset for completeness, although such trades **will not** contribute towards the scoring evaluation. So we will ignore it.

1. Import the necessary libraries: NumPy, pandas, and plotly.
2. Define a function that takes in a probability and returns a dictionary with the following keys:

	* ""mean_annualized_return"": the mean of the annualized returns for the given probability
	* ""q25_return"": the 25th quantile of the annualized returns for the given probability
	* ""q75_return"": the 75th quantile of the annualized returns for the given probability
3. Use the function to generate a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents the results for a different probability.
4. Create a pandas DataFrame from the list of dictionaries.
5. Use plotly to create a scatter plot with the ""mean_mae"" on the x-axis and the ""mean_annualized_return"" on the y-axis.
6. Add a line to the plot for the ""mean_annualized_return"" and a fill between the ""q25_return"" and ""q75_return"" lines.
7. Customize the plot layout, including the title, x-axis title, y-axis title, and legend.

<</SYS>>

Write Python code to perform the following tasks:

1. Import the necessary libraries: NumPy, pandas, and plotly.
2. Define a function that takes in a probability and returns a dictionary with the following keys:
	* ""prob"": the input probability
	* ""mean_mae"": the mean of the MAEs for the given probability
	* ""mean_annualized_return"": the mean of the annualized returns for the given probability
	* ""q25_return"": the 25th quantile of the annualized returns for the given probability
	* ""q75_return"": the 75th quantile of the annualized returns for the given probability
3. Use the function to generate a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents the results for a different probability.
4. Create a pandas DataFrame from the list of dictionaries.
5. Use plotly to create a scatter plot with the ""mean_mae"" on the x-axis and the ""mean_annualized_return"" on the y-axis.
6. Add a line to the plot for the ""mean_annualized_return"" and a fill between the ""q25_return"" and ""q75_return"" lines.
7. Customize the plot layout, including the title, x-axis title, y-axis title, and legend.
8. Display the plot using plotly's `iplot` function.[/INST] ```

* [Basic linear processes](#section-one)
* [Beyond ARMA](#section-two)
* [Full pipeline](#section-three)
* [A day at the races](#section-four)

9139,1403,22,"# Discourse Semantics

**Discourse Representation Theory**

* A discourse is a sequence of sentences. Very often, the interpretation of a sentence in a discourse depends what preceded it. A clear example of this comes from anaphoric pronouns, such as he, she and it. Given discourse such as Angus used to have a dog. But he recently disappeared., you will probably interpret he as referring to Angus's dog. However, in Angus used to have a dog. He took him for walks in New Town., you are more likely to interpret he as referring to Angus himself.

a. Angus owns a dog. It bit Irene.

b. ∃x.(dog(x) ∧ own(Angus, x) ∧ bite(x, Irene))

* That is, the NP a dog acts like a quantifier which binds the it in the second sentence. Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) was developed with the specific goal of providing a means for handling this and other semantic phenomena which seem to be characteristic of discourse.

# ROC'S of the Models

Ok I'm going with the parts are that not much needed for this competition but I still want to apply them for the sake of learning and improving. Here are the results:

### [Back To Table of Contents](#toc_section)","Write Python code to create a function called m_roc that takes in four arguments:

* estimators: a list of machine learning estimators
* cv: a cross-validation object
* X: a pandas DataFrame containing the features
* y: a pandas Series containing the target variable

The function should perform the following steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries: matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, and pandas
2. Create a figure and axes object using the subplots function from matplotlib.pyplot
3. Loop through each estimator in the list of estimators
4. For each estimator, create a new axis object and plot the ROC curve using the plot_roc_curve function from scikit-learn
5. Compute the mean and standard deviation of the ROC curve and plot them as a shaded region
6. Plot the mean ROC curve as a solid line
7. Set the x and y limits of the axis object
8. Set the title of the axis object
9. Show the plot using the show function from matplotlib.pyplot

The function should return the figure and axes object.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```

8282,1741,1,"# CNN Exercise - Deep Learning for Computer Vision
__Introduction:__

Deep neural networks have tremendous potential to learn complex non-linear functions, patterns, and representations. This includes real-world applications like image categorization and classification and the very popular concept of image artistic style transfer. Computer vision is all about the art and science of making machines understand high-level useful patterns and representations from images and videos so that it would be able to make intelligent decisions similar to what a human would do upon observing its surroundings. 

Convolutional neural networks or CNNs are extensively used for automated feature extraction in images.  In fact, CNNs are similar to the general deep neural networks, but with explicit assumption of input being a data set where which the location of a feature is relevant can be attempted via CNNs  like image, but not limited to then. Others examples are:
- ***Time series***: your data is well ordered. A time series problem would make a 1–d convolution the right choice.
- ***Weather***: Build a map of current weather conditions (location-based values, but not actual images). Add another dimension to it for the previous weather maps (in order) and you have a 4–d convolution problem to predict the weather.

This notebook explore convolutional neural networks through the task of image classification using publicly dataset  CIFAR-10. We will utilize our understanding of CNNs to then take on the task of style transfer and understand how neural networks can be used to understand high-level features. Through this notebook, we cover the following topics:
- Image classification use CNNs from scratch
- Transfer learning: image classification using pretrained models
- Neural style transfer using CNNs

For an in-depth understanding of CNNs applied for visual recognition take look on the [Stanford course material](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks). Let us see a little brief overview of its key concepts:
- ***A CNN is made up of Layers***: Every Layer has a simple API: It transforms an input 3D volume to an output 3D volume with some differentiable function that may or may not have parameters. the main layers are:
    - ***Convolutional Layer***: Is a set of slides or convolves learnable filters, also known as kernels or convolution matrix, to help capture spatial features. These cover the width, height and the full depth (color range) of the image. During the forward pass, we slide the filter across the width and the height of the image while computing the dot product between the filter attributes and the input at any position. The output is a two-dimensional activation map from each filter, which are then stacked to get the final output.
    - ***Pooling Layer***: These are basically down-sampling layers used to reduce spatial size and number of parameters by apply functions such as max, average, L2-norm, and so on. These layers also help in controlling overfitting.  These layers are insert in between conv layers or in the end of a sequence of them.
    - ***Fully Connected Layer***: This layer helps perform the tasks of classification. It is similar to fully connected layers in general neural networks. These have full connections to all neurons in the previous layer and can followed by a Dropout to help to reduce overfit.
- ***Parameter Sharing***: Conv layers use same set of weights across the filters thus reducing the overall number of parameters required.

CNNs have gone through tremendous research and advancements have led to more complex and power architectures, like VGG-16, VGG-19, Inception V3, and many models that are more interesting.

Let's start our studies:

# Basic linear processes

Until 1980s, ARIMA processes were the workhorses of time series analysis, which for many people meant just finding right order of such model. This class of processes is defined through linear relationship between observation and noise factors.

Just to indulge my inner nerd, I will go top-down in this one and start from a high level definition - because why not :-) A linear process is a time series $X_t$ defined by:

\begin{equation}
    X_t = \sum_{u = -\infty}^{\infty} \psi_u \epsilon_{t-u}
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon_t$ is a white noise series and 

\begin{equation}
\sum_{u = -\infty}^{\infty} \left|\psi_u \right|^2 < \infty
\end{equation}


Translated to plain English:
* (in our context) white noise a serially uncorrelated sequence of random variables with zero mean and finite variance. For a general definition (and the origin of the color convention) I can recommend the Wikipedia entry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise

* it is a linear combination - potentially infinite and depending on both past and present - of a white noise series

* in the real world it has to be causal $\implies$ depending on a finite number of past values

* it is a unified framework for handling different types of data generating processes

* for the mathematically inclided person reading this: huge parts of the theory behind ARMA processes pop up as special cases / corrolaries from results in functional analysis, specifically the [Hilbert projection theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_projection_theorem) and [spectral theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theorem); the requirement on sum of squared values being finite correspond to belonging to an $l_2$ space for our sequence: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp_space

* only needs second order statistics (variance) $\rightarrow$ works best for elliptical distributions (e.g. Gaussian)

## AR processesThe simplest (non-trivial) example of a linear process is an autoregressive process of order $p$:

\begin{equation}
    X_t = \sum_{i= 1}^p \phi_i X_{t-i} + \epsilon_t
\end{equation}
    
Unpacking the formula:
1. Natural extension of a multiple linear regression model: we forecast the variable of interest using a linear combination of past values of the variable (lagged values act as predictors). The term \textit{auto}regression reflects the fact that we are regressing the variable on (version of) itself
2. The single exponential smoothing method (described [here](https://www.kaggle.com/konradb/ts-1a-smoothing-methods) ) can be viewed as a special case of an autoregressive process of order 1
3. Easy to estimate parameters and forecast 


Now that we have defined (and hopefully understood) what an AR process is, let's have a look at how to identify one. This is relevant if we need to decide whether an autoregressive process is a right kind of model for a particular dataset. For the sake of demonstration, we will use simulated data, where the data generating process is:

\begin{equation}
    X_t = 0.9 X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t
\end{equation}
    
Observe in the codeblock below that the coefficient changes sign - this is because of the notational convention in statsmodels, where we read the coefficients in order defined by the characteristic polynomial (more on that below):

\begin{equation}
    X_t - 0.9 X_{t-1} = \epsilon_t
\end{equation}
A fast technique for deciding if AR is the right kind of model for a given series is to examine the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions (described [here](https://www.kaggle.com/konradb/practical-time-series-pt-1-the-basics#Dependence)). ","Write Python code to import the NumPy library as np, create an ARMA process with an autoregressive order of 1 and a moving average order of 1, generate a sample of 1000 observations from the process, plot the simulated data, and display the ACF and PACF plots.","ar1 = np.array([1, -0.9])

- `Group <= 0.5` checks what group the applicant belongs to: if the applicant belongs to Group A, then `Group <= 0.5` is true.
- Entries like `Income <= 80210.5` check the applicant's income.

To follow the flow chart, we start at the top and trace a path depending on the details of the applicant.  If the condition is true at a split, then we move down and to the left branch.  If it is false, then we move to the right branch.

For instance, consider an applicant in Group B, who has an income of 75k.  Then, 
- We start at the top of the flow chart.  the applicant has an income of 75k, so `Income <= 80210.5` is true, and we move to the left.
- Next, we check the income again. Since `Income <= 71909.5` is false, we move to the right.
- The last thing to check is what group the applicant belongs to.  The applicant belongs to Group B, so `Group <= 0.5` is false, and we move to the right, where the model has decided to approve the applicant.

# What is about ?

Educational notebook on the new breakthough gradient boosting package ""PYBOOST"". 

### PYBOOST - is the best boosting for MULTI-target tasks

It designed especially for MULTI-Target(!) tasks.  For such tasks it consitenly outperforms the other boostings,
as well as incomparably faster. 

#### PYBOOST -> Gold on Kaggle

Pyboost is created by team lead by the Kaggle Grandmaster - Btbpanda - Anton Vakhrushev  https://www.kaggle.com/btbpanda

He and others got many gold medals on Kaggle: recent CAFA5 (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cafa-5-protein-function-prediction/discussion/434064 ),
last year ""Open Problems"" top7-team ""Chromosom"", and public top2 team, etc.

Some inpendent check - PyBoost outperaforming other boostings:  ""Table 2. Performance of Kinase Activity Prediction Modelsa""
https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c00132

#### PYBOOST - easy to use - similar interface and params as other boostings and sklearn models

    model = GradientBoosting('mse')
    model.fit(X,Y)
    model.predict(X)
    
    Main params are similar to other boostings:
    # ntrees - number of trees (iterations)
    # lr  - learning rate
    # max_depth - maximal depth for trees
    # subsample - subsampling fraction
    # colsample - subsampleling fraction for columns
    # Etc 
    # Example:
    model = GradientBoosting('mse', ntrees=ntrees, lr=lr,  max_depth=max_depth  , subsample=subsample, colsample=colsample, min_data_in_leaf=1, min_gain_to_split=0, verbose=100  )
    

#### OP2 - easily LB-score 0.604 -  welcome improve it 

The present notebooks shares a Pyboost prediction with LB 0.604 sore - one of the best public solo-model solutions for the moment.

Welcome to improve it with more tuning.  Notebook provides simple framework to tune - just change the intervals of the params - and run it.
Submissions will be saved to CSV files. Try: more iterations, tune colsample, other params, encoders, average several random seeds, etc...
The default tuning is done by ""AmbrosM"" validation scheme, you can change it to MT, Random or any other scheme. The LB - CV correspondence is poor,
but still not absent. 

The LB604 file prediction can be found in Kaggle dataset: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexandervc/open-problems-2-submits-collection?select=LB604_PyboostLeaveOneOutTsvd50maxdepth10ntrees1000lr001subsample1colsample02_Alex_nbV19.csv

#### PYBOOST - is for GPU

Current version of Pyboost requires GPU.

#### Organization of the notebook

    Section: "" PY-BOOST Install (GPU only) "" 
    Shows how to install/import pyboost - do not forget to turn on GPU.

    Section: "" Modeling ""
    Contains the main modeling example.
    One can see how simple is to use the pyboost.
    
    Also:
    
    a kind of grid-search loops to change some (not all) params are provided
    as well as cross-validation scoring.
    Scoring and other stastistics are saved to dataframe ""df_stat"" 
    It can be used to choose the best candidate for submission.
    All the models generate submissions which are saved to csv
    (To turn it off set: flag_save_each_model_submit = False) 
    
    Other sections provide auxiliary code:
    data load,     custom cross-validation scheme,     etc.
    
    The section ""  Outcomes of early versions ""
    contains brief results of the tuning in the early versions of the notebook.
    The main outcome seems to be - use target encoding instead of one-hot or ordinal.
    We have not tuned much for target encoders - welcome to do it - improve the score.

7134,3034,10,We can see that there is a clear radial dependency of the charge as well as a dependency with specific accumulations (angles). ### What about dipole moments?The dipole moment tells us something about the way charges are distributed within a molecule. Some couplings like FH causes electron to move closer to one atom of the pair than to the otherone. In this case a small separation of charges has happened which will result in a non-zero dipole moment.

- If we neglect the people who did not answered the question. We can see that the percentage decreases as the number of computer vision methods increases.### Which computer vision methods are used together","Write Python code to create a heatmap of the values in the column 'column_name' of a DataFrame df, and display the plot.

The code is using the Plotly library to create the heatmap. It first imports the necessary libraries, including Plotly and NumPy. It then reads a CSV file named 'filename.csv' into a pandas DataFrame named df.

The code then defines a list of columns to be used in the heatmap, and creates a new DataFrame named df1 with the same columns as df, but with an additional column for the year. It then loops through each year in the DataFrame df and creates a sparse matrix of the values in the column 'column_name' for that year. It then multiplies the sparse matrix by its transpose, and sets the diagonal to zero. It then converts the sparse matrix to a dense matrix and creates a new DataFrame named m03 with the same columns as df1, but with the values in the column 'column_name' for that year.

The code then divides the values in the column 'column_name' for that year by the number of rows in the DataFrame df, and multiplies the result by 100. It then creates a new DataFrame named occ with the same columns as df1, but with the values in the column 'column_name' for that year.

The code then concatenates the DataFrames df1 and occ, and creates a new DataFrame named df1 with the concatenated columns. It then converts the column 'Year' to an object type.

The code then creates a Plotly figure named fig, and adds a trace to it using the Plotly heatmap function. It sets the z-values to the values in the column 'column_name' for the year 2022, the x-values to the columns of the DataFrame df1, the y-values to the index of the DataFrame df1, and the name of the trace to ""Selection1"". It also sets the hoverinfo to ""none"", the text to the values in the column 'column_name' for the year 2022, the texttemplate to ""<span style='color:#153d4d; font-family:Helvetica'>%{text:.2f}</span>"", the textfont to a dictionary with the color, family, and size, and the colorscale to a list of colors.

Write Python code to create a heatmap of the co-occurrence of the platforms mentioned in the survey data. The heatmap should have the platforms as the rows and columns, and the values in the heatmap should represent the number of times each platform was mentioned together. The heatmap should be displayed with a title, caption, and axis labels. The axis labels should be rotated by 90 degrees. The heatmap should be displayed in a Jupyter notebook.

Here is the instruction:

1. Import the necessary libraries, including NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib.
2. Load the survey data into a pandas DataFrame.
3. Create a list of the platforms mentioned in the survey data.
4. Create a new DataFrame that contains the co-occurrence of the platforms.
5. Convert the DataFrame to a sparse matrix.
6. Multiply the sparse matrix by its transpose to create a new sparse matrix that represents the co-occurrence of the platforms.
7. Reset the diagonal of the new sparse matrix.
8. Convert the new sparse matrix to a dense matrix.
9. Create a new DataFrame from the dense matrix.
10. Divide the new DataFrame by the number of rows in the original DataFrame to get the co-occurrence of the platforms.
11. Multiply the co-occurrence DataFrame by 100 to get the percentage of times each platform was mentioned together.

So I invite you to **look at it directly on my Github at** :

>_""Science without conscience is but the ruin of the Soul"" - Rabelais (who first quoted the word ""automaton"" in french during the 16th century)_

Machine Learning Interpretability of is a hot and crucial subject : machine learning algorithms are everywhere, becoming more and more ubiquitous, complex and efficient, and sometimes treated like __black-boxes__. They have already, and will have in the future, more and more impact on our society and our everyday's life. As (future) Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineers, even if we clearly don't need interpretability all the time, I think we have a social and professional ethical duty trying to design models as **fair, accountable and transparent** as possible. Meaning : unbiasedness/non-discriminative, giving reliable results and being able to be queried to validate predictive decisions.The recent European GDRP (General Data Protection Regulation) resolution testifies to a citizen ""right to explanation"" of algorithmic decisions that ""significantly"" affect any individual. Further more, interpreting our machine learning processes could give us valuable insights for :

- debugging
- informing feature engineering
- model comparisons
- driving future data collection
- informing human decision-making
- and generally for better communication and trust building.

The intend of this tutorial is twofold :
- to give a basic introduction to the subject, looking at different strategies for tackling the potential ""black-box"" problem in a **model-agnostic** fashion. 
- to have a practical grasp on some of the main frameworks actually available for machine learning interpretability like __ELI5, LIME, SKATER, or SHAP__ (and also PDPbox and FairML). 

After loading and providing a [description of the data](#descrip_data), a [quick EDA](#eda), and [training/evaluating our model](#model), we will be exploring more in depth differents interpretation techniques like : 

1. [Features Importance (without and with permutation)](#features_importance)
2. [Partial Dependence Plots (PD plot)](#pd_plots) &  [Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots](#ice_plots)
3. [Model Prediction Explanations with Local Interpretation (LIME)](#lime)
4. [SKATER model interpretation](#skater)
5. [Building Interpretable Models with Surrogate Tree-based Models (SKATER)](#skater_tree)
6. [Model Prediction Explanation with SHAP values](#shap)
7. [Dependence and Interaction Plots (SHAP)](#shap_plots)
8. [Bonus : auditing our ""black-box predictive model"" with FairML](#fairml)
9. [Further readings and conclusion](#further_readings)

We will work :
- on a real-world dataset about Red Wine Quality (after all ethics can, and should also be convivial ;)) 
- with an XGBoost model, which is a complex optimized distributed gradient boosting library providing a parallel tree boosting algorithm 
- and the learning task will be a classical supervised classification with binarized classes.
