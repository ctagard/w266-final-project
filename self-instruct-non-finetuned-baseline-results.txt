Define the `search` function, which will be the main entry point for the search functionality.\n2. Inside the `search` function, define a `document_change` function that will be called whenever the user selects a different document from the dropdown menu. This function will update the information displayed in the result tab.\n3. Define a `render_tab` function that will be called to render the result tab. This function will take a `tab` object and a `r` object as input, and will update the tab\'s children and title.\n4. Define a `run_search` function that will be called when the user clicks the "Search" button. This function will perform the search and update the search results.\n5. Define a `search_text` widget, a `number_of_documents` widget, and a `run_button` widget. The `search_text` widget will allow the user to enter a search query, the `number_of_documents` widget will allow the user to specify the number of documents to return, and the `run_button` widget will allow the user to initiate the search.\n6. Define a `search_in_progress` label that will be displayed while the search is in progress.\n7. Define a `doc_select` widget that will be used to display the search results.\n8.

Please wrap your code using ```.\n<</SYS>>\n\nThis code is a Python script that generates a submission for a Kaggle competition. It uses a Markov chain to generate a sequence of words that are likely to be relevant to the competition.\n\nHere\'s a step-by-step breakdown of the code:\n\n1. The first few lines import the necessary libraries, including NumPy, pandas, and the Kaggle API.\n2. The next block of code sets the random seed to 23, which is used to generate the Markov chain.\n3. The words variable is created by reading in a CSV file named "traink.Writeup.csv" and extracting the unique words from it.\n4. The rands variable is created by generating a random matrix of size (len(words), 3) and converting it to a DataFrame.\n5. The words variable is then concatenated with the rands variable, and the resulting DataFrame is converted to a dictionary.\n6. The seq variable is created by joining the values in the Writeup column of the traink DataFrame into a single string and splitting it into a list of words.\n7. The counts variable is created by counting the frequency of each word in the seq variable.\n8. The words dictionary is updated by averaging the values of the current word and the next word in the sequence.\n9. The first testing block of code is used to generate a submission for the competition. It first creates a DataFrame from the words dictionary and adds a "counts" column to it. It then sorts the DataFrame by the "dist" column and selects the top 255 words.\n10. The second testing block of code is used to generate a submission for the competition. It first creates a DataFrame from the bigrams of the Writeup column of the traink DataFrame. It then groups the DataFrame by the "w1" column and aggregates the "w2" column by joining the values.\n11. The out variable is created by starting with the "Winning" word and adding random words from the generated DataFrame until the length of the out variable is 255.\n12. The final step is to write the submission to a CSV file named "submission.csv".[/INST]  ```\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom kaggle.api.kaggle_api_extended import KaggleApi\n\n# Set random seed for reproducibility\nnp.random.seed(23)\n\n# Load data\nwords = pd.read_csv("traink.Writeup.csv")["Writeup"].unique()\n\n# Generate random matrix\nrands = np.random.rand(len(words), 3)\nrands = pd.DataFrame(rands, columns=["rand1", "rand2", "rand3"])\n\n# Concatenate words and random matrix\nwords_rands = pd.concat([words, rands], axis=1)\nwords_rands = words_rands.to_dict()\n\n# Generate sequence of words\nseq = " ".join(traink["Writeup"].values).split()\n\n# Count frequency of each word\ncounts = pd.Series(seq).value_counts()\n\n# Update words dictionary\nfor i in range(len(seq) - 1):\n    words[seq[i]] = (words[seq'}]

Please wrap your code using ```.\n<</SYS>>\n\nThis code is a Python script that performs a series of operations on a dataset of protein structures and their corresponding mutations. The script first imports several libraries, including pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. It then reads in a CSV file containing the protein structures and their mutations, and performs some preprocessing operations on the data.\n\nThe script then defines a function called "get_test_mutation" that takes a row of the data as input and returns a new row with the wildtype and mutation information for that row. It also defines a variable called "deletions" that contains a list of protein sequence IDs that correspond to deletions.\n\nThe script then applies the "get_test_mutation" function to the data, and uses the "isin" method to identify rows that correspond to deletions. It then replaces the mutation information for these rows with a placeholder value.\n\nThe script then reads in a set of PDB files containing the structures of the wildtype and mutant proteins, and uses the "PandasPdb" library to extract the b-factor values for each residue. It then calculates the difference in b-factor values between the wildtype and mutant proteins for each residue, and stores the results in a list called "diffs".\n\nThe script then creates a new dataframe called "submission" that contains the difference in b-factor values for each residue, as well as the corresponding protein sequence IDs. It then uses the "rankdata" function to rank the difference in b-factor values, and calculates a weighted average of the ranks based on the "tm" column of the "submission" dataframe.\n\nFinally, the script plots a histogram of the weighted average ranks, and saves the resulting plot to a file called "submission.csv".[/INST]  ```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pandas.pdb import PandasPdb\n\n# Read in CSV file containing protein structures and mutations\ndata = pd.read_csv("data.csv")\n\n# Define function to get wildtype and mutation information for each row\ndef get_test_mutation(row):\n    wildtype = row["wildtype"]\n    mutation = row["mutation"]\n    return {"wildtype": wildtype, "mutation": mutation}\n\n# Apply function to data and identify rows corresponding to deletions\ndeletions = data["sequence_id"].isin(["DEL"])\ndata_with_mutations = data.apply(get_test_mutation, axis=1)\n\n# Read in PDB files containing protein structures\nwildtype_pdb = PandasPdb.read_pdb("wildtype.pdb")\nmutant_pdb = PandasPdb.read_pdb("mutant.pdb")\n\n# Extract b-factor values for each residue\nwildtype_'}]

Please wrap your code using ```.\n<</SYS>>\n\nThis code is a Python script that performs a series of operations on a dataset, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. The script uses several libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, to perform these operations.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the code:\n\n1. The script starts by importing the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.\n2. The script then defines a function called `OHE` (One-Hot Encoding) that takes in a dataset, a list of columns to encode, and a target column. The function performs one-hot encoding on the specified columns and returns the encoded dataset.\n3. The script then defines a table to store the results of the operations performed on the dataset.\n4. The script then loops through each column in the dataset that is considered "unimportant" (i.e., not used in the model).\n5. For each column, the script performs the following operations:\n\na. It concatenates the training and testing dataframes to create a single dataframe that contains both the training and testing data.\n\nb. It performs one-hot encoding on the column using the `pd.get_dummies` function.\n\nc. It calculates the number of unique values in the column using the `value_counts` function.\n\nd. It identifies the column with the minimum number of unique values.\n\ne. It drops the column with the minimum number of unique values from the one-hot encoded dataframe.\n\nf. It concatenates the one-hot encoded dataframe with the original dataframe.\n\ng. It drops the original column from the dataframe.\n\nh. It drops any duplicate columns from the dataframe.\n\ni. It splits the dataframe back into training and testing dataframes.\n\nj. It performs mean encoding on the target column using the `np.log1p` function.\n\nk. It performs linear regression on the mean encoded target column using the `LinearRegression` class from the `sklearn.linear_model` module.\n\nl. It calculates the mean absolute error (MAE) for the linear regression model using the `mean_absolute_error` function from the `sklearn.metrics` module.\n\nm. It adds a row to the table with the results of the linear regression model.\n\nn. It performs one-hot encoding on the cluster column using the `OHE` function.\n\no. It performs linear regression on the one-hot encoded cluster column using the `LinearRegression` class from the `sklearn.linear_model` module.\n\np. It calculates the MAE for the linear regression model using the `mean_absolute_error` function from the `sklearn.metrics` module.\n\nq.

In this case, the information is the percentage of each education level.\n* `textposition`: The position of the text on each slice of the pie chart. In this case, the text is displayed inside the slice.\n* `hole`: The hole in the center of the pie chart. In this case, the hole is 0.6, which means that 60% of the pie chart is empty.\n* `showlegend`: Whether to show the legend for the pie chart. In this case, the legend is shown.\n* `marker`: The marker style for the slices of the pie chart. In this case, the marker is a filled rectangle with a black outline.\n\nThe script then creates a figure object using the `go.Figure` function, which takes the data and layout as arguments.

It then defines the MultiHeadAttention layer, which takes in the depth of the d-dimensional space used for positional encoding (`d_model`) and the number of heads to use in the multi-head-attention block (`num_heads`). The layer also defines the weights for the query, key, and value tensors using the `tf.keras.layers.Dense` layer.\n\nThe `split_heads` function is used to split the last dimension of the input tensors into `num_heads` and `depth`. The `call` function then computes the attention weights using the scaled dot-product attention mechanism.

Use a for loop to iterate over the list of top tokens and print the corresponding sequence with the replaced mask token.\n\nHere's the code:\n```\ntop_5_tokens = torch.topk(mask_token_logits, 5, dim=1).indices[0].tolist()\nfor token in top_5_tokens:\n    print(sequence.replace(tokenizer.mask_token, tokenizer.decode([token])))\n```[/INST]  Here's the corrected code:\n```\ntop_5_tokens = torch.topk(mask_token_logits, 5, dim=1).indices[0].tolist()\nfor token in top_5_tokens:\n    print(sequence.replace(tokenizer.mask_token, tokenizer.decode([token])))\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. The `torch.topk()` function is used to extract the top 5 tokens from the mask token logits. The `dim=1` argument specifies that the top tokens should be extracted along the first dimension (i.e., the sequence dimension).\n2.

The graph should have 10 bars, with the bars representing the drivers in descending order of their total points. The graph should also have a title, and the bars should be colored based on the driver\'s position in the table.

The script then applies a sentiment analysis algorithm to the "reviewText" column of the DataFrame, using the TextBlob library to calculate the sentiment score for each review.

The CountVectorizer class takes a corpus of text as input and returns a matrix of word frequencies.

The script then prints the top 5 words with the highest frequency in the bag-of-words representation, using the "get_feature_names" method of the CountVectorizer object and the "toarray" method of the resulting matrix.\n\nOverall, this script demonstrates how to perform feature engineering on a dataset of movie reviews using Python and scikit-learn.[/INST]  ```\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom textblob import TextBlob\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n\n# Read in movie review data from CSV file\ndf = pd.read_csv("movie_reviews.csv")\n\n# Apply sentiment analysis using TextBlob\ndf["sentiment_label"] = df["reviewText"].apply(lambda x: "pos" if TextBlob(x).sentiment.polarity > 0 else "neg")\n\n# Perform data cleaning and preprocessing\ndf.dropna(inplace=True)\nle = LabelEncoder()\ndf["sentiment_label"] = le.fit_transform(df["sentiment_label"])\n\n# Create bag-of-words representation of movie review text\ncount_vectorizer = CountVectorizer(analyzer="word", ngram_range=(2, 2))\nX_count = count_vectorizer.fit_transform(df["reviewText"])\n\n# Print top 5 words with highest frequency in bag-of-words representation\nprint(count'}]

Please wrap your code using ```.\n<</SYS>>\n\nWrite Python code to calculate the covariance matrix of a DataFrame df_new, extract the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, calculate the explained variance from the eigenvalues, and plot the individual and cumulative explained variance.\n\nHere\'s a step-by-step breakdown of the code:\n\n1. Calculate the covariance matrix of the DataFrame df_new:\n```\ncov_mat = np.cov(df_new.iloc[:, :-1].T)\n```\nThis line calculates the covariance matrix of the DataFrame df_new, excluding the last column. The `np.cov()` function calculates the covariance matrix of a set of vectors, and the `.iloc[:, :-1].T` syntax extracts the values of the DataFrame as a set of vectors.\n\n2. Extract the eigenvalues and eigenvectors:\n```\neig_vals, eig_vecs = np.linalg.eig(cov_mat)\n```\nThis line extracts the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. The `np.linalg.eig()` function calculates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix.\n\n3. Calculate the explained variance from the eigenvalues:\n```\ntot = sum(eig_vals)\nvar_exp = [\n    (i / tot) * 100 for i in sorted(eig_vals, reverse=True)\n]  # Individual explained variance\ncum_var_exp = np.cumsum(var_exp)  # Cumulative explained variance\n```\nThis line calculates the individual and cumulative explained variance from the eigenvalues. The `sum()` function calculates the sum of the eigenvalues, and the `sorted()` function sorts the eigenvalues in descending order. The `(i / tot) * 100` expression calculates the percentage of variance explained by each eigenvalue, and the `np.cumsum()` function calculates the cumulative sum of the percentages.\n\n4. Plot the explained variance:\n```\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))\nplt.bar(\n    range(len(var_exp)),\n    var_exp,\n    alpha=0.3333,\n    align="center",\n    label="individual explained variance",\n    color="g",\n)\nplt.step(\n    range(len(var_exp)), cum_var_exp, where="mid", label="cumulative explained variance"\n)\nplt.ylabel("Explained variance ratio")\nplt.xlabel("Principal components")\nplt.legend(loc="best")\nplt.show()\n```\nThis line plots the individual and cumulative explained variance. The `plt.bar()` function plots the individual explained variance as a bar chart, and the `plt.step()` function plots the cumulative explained variance as a step function. The `plt.ylabel()` and `plt.xlabel()` functions set the y-axis and x-axis labels, respectively. The `plt.legend()` function adds a legend to the plot, and the `plt.show()` function displays the plot.[/INST]  ```\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Calculate the covariance matrix of the DataFrame\ncov_mat = np.cov(df_new.iloc[:, :-1].T)\n\n# Extract the eigenvalues and eigenvectors\neig_vals, eig_vecs = np.linalg.eig(cov_mat)\n\n# Calculate the explained variance from the eigenvalues\ntot = sum(eig_vals)\nvar_exp = [(i / tot) * 100 for i in sorted(eig_vals, reverse=True)]\ncum_var_exp = np.cumsum(var_exp)\n\n# Plot the explained variance\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))\nplt.bar(range(len(var_exp)), var_exp, alpha=0.3333, align="center", label="individual explained variance", color="g")\nplt.step(range(len(var_exp)), cum_var_exp, where="mid", label="cumulative explained variance")\npl'}]

Here\'s a step-by-step breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `CUR_X_FILES, CUR_X = list(test_df.fname.values), X_test`: This line of code creates two lists, `CUR_X_FILES` and `CUR_X`, from the `fname` column of the `test_df` DataFrame and the `X_test` variable, respectively.\n2. `test = ImageList.from_csv(WORK / "image", Path("../..") / CSV_SUBMISSION, folder="test")`: This line of code creates an `ImageList` object from a CSV file named `CSV_SUBMISSION` in the `test` folder of the `WORK` directory. The `ImageList` object is then assigned to the `test` variable.\n3. `learn = load_learner(WORK / "image", test=test)`: This line of code loads a pre-trained image classification model using the `load_learner` function from the fast.ai library. The model is loaded from the `WORK/image` directory and the `test` DataFrame is passed as an argument.\n4. `preds, _ = learn.TTA(ds_type=DatasetType.Test)`: This line of code performs test-time augmentation (TTA) on the `test` DataFrame using the pre-trained model. The `ds_type` argument is set to `DatasetType.Test` to indicate that the model is being used for testing. The `preds` variable contains the predicted class labels for the `test` DataFrame.\n5. `test_df[learn.data.classes] = preds`: This line of code adds the predicted class labels to the `test_df` DataFrame. The `learn.data.classes` variable contains the class labels for the pre-trained model.\n6. `test_df.to_csv("submission.csv", index=False)`: This line of code saves the `test_df` DataFrame to a CSV file named `submission.csv`. The `index=False` argument is used to exclude the index column from the CSV file.\n7. `test_df.head()`: This line of code displays the first few rows of the `test_df` DataFrame.\n8. `CUR_X_FILES, CUR_X = list(df.fname.values), X_train`: This line of code creates two lists, `CUR_X_FILES` and `CUR_X`, from the `fname` column of the `df` DataFrame and the `X_train` variable, respectively.\n9. `learn = cnn_learner(data, models.resnet18, pretrained=False, metrics=[lwlrap])`: This line of code creates a new image classification model using the `cnn_learner` function from the fast.ai library. The `data` argument is set to the `df` DataFrame, the `models.resnet18` argument is set to the pre-trained ResNet18 model, and the `pretrained=False` argument is used to indicate that the model is not pre-trained. The `metrics` argument is set to a list containing the `lwlrap` metric.\n10. `learn.load("fat2019_fastai_cnn2d_stage-2")`: This line of code loads a pre-trained image classification model using the `load` function from the fast.ai library.

The chart should be rendered using the Kaggle renderer.\n\nTo do this, you will need to use the following libraries:\n\n* `matplotlib.pyplot` for creating the bar chart\n* `pandas` for working with dataframes\n* `collections` for creating a dictionary to store the frequency of keywords\n* `numpy` for working with arrays\n\nYou will also need to define the following functions:\n\n* `generate_ngrams`: a function that takes a string and an integer `n_gram` as input and returns a list of n-grams (sequences of `n_gram` words) in the string.\n* `horizontal_bar_chart`: a function that takes a dataframe and a color as input and returns a bar chart that shows the frequency of words in the dataframe.\n\nTo create the chart, you will need to do the following:\n\n1. Load the data into a dataframe using `pandas`.\n2. Create a dictionary to store the frequency of keywords using `collections.defaultdict`.\n3. Iterate over the tweets in the dataframe and count the frequency of each keyword using the `generate_ngrams` function.\n4. Create a dataframe from the dictionary using `pandas` and sort it by frequency.\n5. Create a bar chart for each subplot using the `horizontal_bar_chart` function.\n6. Create the chart layout using `matplotlib.pyplot.subplots` and add the subplots to the layout.\n7. Update the layout with the title, height, width, and background color.\n8. Display the chart using `matplotlib.pyplot.show`.\n\nHere is an example of how you could implement this:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\n# Load the data into a dataframe\ndf = pd.read_csv("tweets.csv")\n\n# Create a dictionary to store the frequency of keywords\nfreq_dict = defaultdict(int)\n\n# Iterate over the tweets and count the frequency of each keyword\nfor sent in df["keyword"]:\n    for word in generate_ngrams(str(sent)):\n        freq_dict[word] += 1\n\n# Create a dataframe from the dictionary and sort it by frequency\nfd_sorted = pd.DataFrame(sorted(freq_dict.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])[::-1])\nfd_sorted.columns = ["word", "wordcount"]\n\n# Create a bar chart for each subplot\ntrace0 = horizontal_bar_chart(fd_sorted.head(30), "blue")\ntrace1 = horizontal_bar_chart(fd_sorted.tail(30), "red")\n\n# Create the chart layout\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 5))\naxs[0].set_title("Frequent keyword if tweet is not real disaster")\naxs[1].set_title("Frequent keyword if tweet is real disaster")\n\n# Update the layout with the title, height, width, and background color\nfig.update_layout(title="Word Count Plots", height=500, width=1000, paper_bgcolor="rgb(233,233,233)")\n\n# Display the chart\nfig.show()\n```[/INST]  ```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\n# Load the data into a dataframe\ndf = pd.read_csv("tweets.csv")\n\n# Create a dictionary to store the frequency of keywords\nfreq_dict = defaultdict(int)\n\n# Iterate over the tweets and count the frequency of each keyword\nfor sent in df["keyword"]:\n    for word in generate_ngrams(str(sent)):\n        freq_dict[word] += 1\n\n# Create a dataframe from the dictionary and sort it by frequency\nfd_sorted = pd.DataFrame(sorted(freq_dict.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])[::-1])\nfd_sorted.columns = ["word", "wordcount"]\n\n# Create a bar chart for each subplot\ntrace0 = horizontal_bar_chart(fd_sorted.head(30), "blue")\ntrace1 = horizontal_bar_chart(fd_sorted.tail(30), "red")\n\n# Create the chart layout\nfig, axs = plt.sub'}]

The `cv` object has a `best_score_` attribute that stores the best CV score found during the search. The `best_score_` attribute is a float value that represents the best CV score found during the search.

The resulting DataFrame is then indexed to get the values of the "Q19" column, and the `value_counts` method is used to count the number of times each value appears.

Here\'s a step-by-step breakdown of the code and the instructions that would result in it:\n\n1. `import numpy as np`: This line imports the NumPy library, which is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. The library provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, among other things.\n2. `import pandas as pd`: This line imports the pandas library, which is a library for data manipulation and analysis. The library provides data structures and functions for working with structured data, such as tabular data.\n3. `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`: This line imports the matplotlib library, which is a library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. The library provides a wide range of tools for creating various types of plots, charts, and graphs.\n4. `corr_train_df = (train_df.select_dtypes(["int", "float"]).drop(columns=["Unnamed: 0"]).corr())`: This line of code creates a new DataFrame called `corr_train_df` by selecting only the integer and float columns from the `train_df` DataFrame, dropping the "Unnamed: 0" column, and then computing the correlation matrix of the remaining columns.\n5. `corr_cols = corr_train_df.columns`: This line of code creates a list called `corr_cols` that contains the names of the columns in the `corr_train_df` DataFrame.\n6. `for i in range(len(corr_cols)):`: This line of code starts a for loop that iterates over the columns in the `corr_train_df` DataFrame.\n7. `for j in range(i + 1, len(corr_cols)):`: This line of code starts a nested for loop that iterates over the columns in the `corr_train_df` DataFrame, starting from the column after the current column.\n8. `if corr_train_df.iloc[i, j] >= 0.9:`: This line of code checks if the correlation between the current column and the column after it is greater than or equal to 0.9.\n9. `print(corr_cols[i], corr_cols[j], corr_train_df.iloc[i, j])`: This line of code prints the names of the current column and the column after it, along with the correlation value between them.\n10. `target_corr = corr_train_df.loc["Class", :].sort_values(ascending=False).to_frame().T`: This line of code creates a new DataFrame called `target_corr` by selecting only the "Class" column from the `corr_train_df` DataFrame, sorting the values in the "Class" column in descending order, and then converting the resulting DataFrame to a transposed matrix.\n11. `display(target_corr)`: This line of code displays the `target_corr` DataFrame in a table format.\n12. `fig = plt.figure(figsize=(25, 5))`: This line of code creates a new figure object called `fig` with a size of 25x5 inches.\n13. `target_corr.iloc[0, 1:].plot()`: This line of code plots the correlation values in the "Class" column against the other columns in the `target_corr` DataFrame, starting from the second column.\n14. `plt.show()`: This line of code displays the plot.\n15. `test_num_df = test_df.select_dtypes(["int", "float"]).drop(columns=["Unnamed: 0", "Class"])`: This line of code creates a new DataFrame called `test_num_df` by selecting only the integer and float columns from the `test_df` DataFrame, dropping the "Unnamed: 0" and "Class" columns, and then converting the resulting DataFrame to a numerical DataFrame.\n\nIn summary, this code performs various data preprocessing tasks on a dataset, including computing the correlation matrix of the columns, selecting only the integer and float columns, dropping the "Unnamed: 0" and "Class" columns, and then converting the resulting DataFrame to a numerical DataFrame.[/INST]  ```\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load the dataset\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv("train.csv")\ntest_df = pd.read_csv("test.csv")\n\n# Compute the correlation matrix of the columns\ncorr_train_df = (train_df.select_dtypes(["int", "float"]).drop(columns=["Unnamed: 0"]).corr())\n\n# Create a list of the column names\ncorr_cols = corr_train_df.columns\n\n# Iterate over the columns and print the correlation values\nfor i in range(len(corr_cols)):\n    for j in range(i + 1, len(corr_cols)):\n        if corr_train_df.iloc[i, j] >= 0.9:\n            print(corr_cols[i], corr_cols[j], corr_train_df.iloc[i, j])\n\n# Create a new DataFrame with the correlation values of the "Class" column\ntarget_corr = corr_train_df.loc["Class", :].'}]
